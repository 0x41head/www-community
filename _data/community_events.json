TLS 1.3 is a great development in the secure transmission of data. But there\u2019s a few security challenges that we need to be ready for. In this talk, I will present the current threat landscape and possible mitigation to some of the known malicious usages of the new privacy features implemented in TLS1.3. We will discuss the impact of TLS 1.3 on Network-based security solutions used by enterprises and public sector given that the several changes introduced in TLS 1.3 have a good goal to improve the overall security and privacy provided. However, some of these changes have a negative impact on network-based security solutions</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Khalid Alsuwaiyel is a Senior Incident Response Consultant in IBM X-Force IR team. He is responsible for the successful execution of incident response and proactive services to the X-Force IR customers in EMEA and globally. He has more than 6 years of professional experience, most of which are on the Digital Forensics team of the Saudi National Cyber Security Center. Khalid worked as a DFIR team leader for key critical National Infrastructures for more than 3 years. He holds the SANS GIAC Defending Advanced Threats (GDAT), GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH) and Certified Threat Hunting Professional certifications along with others.

It's like a code-aware grep, enabling you to easily search for complicated code patterns without writing painful abstract syntax tree (AST) visitors or using heavyweight, expensive, proprietary traditional SAST tools.</p> <p>Key Semgrep features:<br/>- Fast - scans code in minutes, not hours or days.<br/>- Does not require the source code you\u2019re scanning to be buildable.<br/>- Comes out of the box with over 1,000 open source rules covering the OWASP Top 10 and more.<br/>- Supports languages including Python, Java, Golang, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and more on the way.<br/>- Autofix - Don't just point out bugs, help developers fix them!<br/>- Most importantly, Semgrep makes it easy to write custom rules, no fancy DSL required. This empowers AppSec engineers and developers to detect and block company-specific security bugs and anti-patterns as well as enforce best practices.</p> <p>We\u2019ll demo how to easily write custom Semgrep rules tailored to your specific code base, and how to get continuous security coverage in CI in a just a few minutes.</p> <p>Bio: Clint Gibler (@clintgibler) is the Head of Security Research for r2c, a startup working on giving security tools directly to developers. Previously, Clint was a Research Director at NCC Group, a global security consulting firm, where he helped companies implement security automation and DevSecOps best practices as well as performed penetration tests for companies ranging from large enterprises to new startups. Clint has previously spoken at conferences including BlackHat USA, AppSec USA/EU/Cali, BSidesSF, and many DevSecCons. Clint holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Davis.

Threat modeling is considered to be a key activity, but can be challenging to perform for developers, and even more so in agile software development. Hence, threat modeling has not seen widespread use in agile software projects. The goal of the presentation is to show some of these challenges and approaches that the teams are working on.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Dr. Monica Iovan, Head of Security Development, Visma; In her free time, Monica enjoys peaceful moments in nature and the company of a good book. She is a passionate researcher having the goal of simplifying the use of security services within Agile development.

Cruzes is a Professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Previously, she worked as a senior research scientist at SINTEF in Norway. She has also been a researcher fellow at the University of Maryland and Fraunhofer Center for Experimental Software Engineering-Maryland. Dr. Daniela Cruzes received her PhD in experimental software engineering from the University of Campinas - UNICAMP in Brazil in 2007. Her research interests are empirical software engineering, research methods and theory development, synthesis of SE studies, software security, software testing and agile and DevOps.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;Abstract - Security through an iterative process<br/>Security through an iterative process is a collection of notes collected in 15+ years\u2019 experience. We will go through what has worked for most companies, some myths and some of the common things that are typically missing, but that everybody wants.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Dario Cavallaro has been working in IT Security for over 15 years. Passionate about Linux, Opensource and Security, he has been working in both defensive and offensive security industry. Dario has a Bachelor degree in Computer science, where he focused on Software development and Software engineering. Before that, he collaborated with several opensource projects, like Gentoo.</p> "

Despite the benefits threat modeling provides, most development teams don't know how to get started in this practice. This evening's presentation will provide high-level answers to your \"Five Ws\" questions about threat modeling, including: What is a Threat Model? Who should be involved in creating the model? What should the model contain? and, most importantly, How do I create the model?</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Dr. John DiLeo is the Auckland-area leader of the OWASP New Zealand Chapter.

Logs are so much more than just for debugging, mapping system performance or error finding. They tell the tales of what has occurred in a system at any given time. When things never go right I believe one should push left. This means if we do not have logs in Application Development we can use for when a breach occurs we should build them. These philosophies focusses on five things that will help your application logs become more than just there for debugging and performance, they build in forensic readiness for future breaches, it also deals with sensitive data disclosure.</p> <p>Veronica started her forensic career in 2008. She is the Director of Incident Response within DFIRLABS. Veronica is also an Assistant Professor at Noroff University. Veronica holds a Master in Science at Rhodes University in Information Security with specialisation in the forensic analysis of malware. She prides herself in keeping patients safe as this is something which is near to her heart. She is also a cyborg sporting an embedded medical device herself. She also is a DEF CON Goon and she is the founder of DC2751.<br/>Her particular research interests include research into security vulnerabilities in medical devices forming part of the Internet of Things, and how these could be exploited by malicious attackers, as well as what types of forensic artefacts could be identified from any attacks. She is extremely passionate about protecting people whose lives depend on these medical devices, and her passion saw her becoming a researcher within an MDM. She is also developing a digital forensics and incident response approach dealing specifically with implanted medical devices and medical devices installed within a healthcare setting. At her core Veronica is a forensicator and hacker and in love with every bit, byte and nibble of knowledge she has obtained. She recently launched an OWASP project and infiltrated development teams to learn to be green. She is passionate about when things do not go right you push left.</p> <p>Bishakha Jain (@euphoricbint) will speak about \"Manifesting and Mastering the art of Executive presence\".</p> <p>As we climb up the career ladder, we all look for taking up the leadership and shouldering the executive responsibilities going forward.
