Courtesy our sponsors Doppler Inc (https://www.doppler.com/).\n\n[Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/) presents an uncomplicated way to sync, manage, orchestrate, and rotate secrets across any environment or app config with easy to use tools.\n\n**Talk #1**: Meet modern threats with a modern security approach\n\nAbstract: A modern security approach is comprised of more than compliance or having great engineering and security teams. It needs to be a combination of cultural shifts, better security tooling, and making security fit productively into workflows. Doppler shifts the way teams incorporate security approaches by designing security that\u2019s powerful, easy to implement, easy to use, and easy to continuously improve. We\u2019re building tools that pull security into the developer\u2019s workflow with the goal of saving time and helping protect a company's infrastructure against security incidents. Join **Thomas Piccirello**, Co-Founder and CTO of Doppler, as he explains the shift in security, and how teams can secure their infrastructure through automated flows.\n\n**Talk** #2: Automating Security Questionnaires with GPT\n\nA Case Study on Real-World Use Cases and Challenges Summary: In this case study, we'll explore a real-world use case where an LLM-based system is used to automate the process of answering security questionnaires. We'll start by discussing the challenges of accuracy and legality that come with using LLMs in such contexts, including hallucinations, missing information, unanswerable questions, and concerns around intellectual property and confidentiality. Then, we'll walk you through an example generative answering pipeline that uses a state-of-the-art LLM to answer security questionnaire questions with high accuracy and efficiency, while also addressing the legal concerns. By the end of this case study, you'll have a better understanding of how LLMs can be used to solve painful problems in the real world, and what challenges and best practices you need to keep in mind when using them.\n\n**Speaker** :- **Chas Ballew**, CEO and founder of Conveyor\n\n**Talk** 3# Purple Book Community's Software Security Maturity Model.\nDescription :- To be shared later\n\n**Speaker** :- **LingRaj Patil**, Executive Chair at Purple book community"

        "description": "Short Description:\nWe talk a lot about DevSecOps, but what do we really mean when we say that? Nobody really can agree on what it means, and if you listen to vendors it's just security tools embedded in your CI/CD processes. I believe in the original idea of a group of people with backgrounds in development, security, and operations working collaboratively together to build and deploy better, more secure applications. Based on that vision I wrote the DevSecOps Playbook in early 2022 as a list of specific steps that people from all three domains (dev, sec, and ops) can do together. The Playbook is 60 tasks that DevSecOps teams can perform to materially affect their application environments. This presentation will walk the audience through all 55 tasks in the Playbook and show them how to prioritize the tasks for their specific company based on the resources that org has.\n\nLonger Description:\nWhat is DevSecOps? How do I \"do\" it? There's a lot of hype around DevSecOps right now, and getting two people to agree on exactly what it means can be a challenge. Unfortunately, there's a lot of vendor narrative that says it's CI/CD with some security thrown in for good measure, but DevSecOps is a lot more than that! My career was changed by the DevOps movement and I believe that DevSecOps should be built on top of DevOps. What does that mean? Well, what made DevOps so powerful for me in the late 2000's was that it brought together people from different departments to work together. Developers learned more about how to manage the underlying infrastructure, and ops teams learned how to use code to build and manage automation. This was powerful and I believe we can do the same with DevSecOps: bring security teams into the processes and workflows that DevOps built at at the same time those security teams will evolve to understand how operations and development teams work.\nThis talk will cover my DevSecOps Playbook which is an open source step-by-step guide to implementing DevSecOps for any organization. This Playbook is broken down into 5 distinct areas of domain expertise:\nDevelopment Environment\nSource Code Management\nContinuous Integration / Deployment and other Automation\nDeployment Environments\nOrganizational Functions\nThe DevSecOps Playbooks spreads the controls evenly across these 5 domains and highlights that this is a group responsibility. There is also an addendum for compliance frameworks and how they can map to the tasks and controls listed in the Playbook. In this talk I will outline these 5 areas and talk about the different controls and tasks in each. I will also give examples of how to implement a subset of these controls.\n\nLocation of this event coming soon."

CTF will be online. Every registered user will receive the link on May 11th morning. There's gonna be small prices for the winners who will be present on the chapter meeting during the winners announcement.\n\n### CTF led by TunaSec.cz team\n\n* **Filip Holec** \\- Leader of educational Ethical Hacking\\, Linux or Python workshops and Co\\-Founder of https://engeto\\.cz\n* **Martin Zember** \\- 15 years of experience in pentesting\\, Founder of https://zembered\\.com\n* **Petr Skyva** \\- Cyber\\-Security @ FI MUNI\\, Cloud Architect @ Cleverlance\n* **Kamil Vavra** \\- Hacker\\, Bug Bounty hunter \\(https://vavkamil\\.cz\\)\\, AppSec Engineer @ Printify\n\n##\n\n## Information about the speakers and talks\n\n### Fedotkin Zakhar\n\nFedotkin Zakhar (d4d) is a software security researcher with a 10-year experience. There are a number of vulnerabilities discovered by Zakhar in open-source libraries, HTTP clients or 3-rd party extensions primarily written using Java, C++, and PHP programming languages.\n\n**They are dangerous\u2026 so better hack this**\nHard-coded credentials typically create a significant hole that allows an attacker to bypass the authentication that has been configured by the software administrator. In this topic we will talk about HTTP cookies signing algorythms and how they can be exploited to get unathorised access to the application and in worst-case scanario get a remote code execution.\n\n### Marek T\u00f3th\n\nMarek T\u00f3th is a vulnerability researcher at Excello. He is highly interested in web application security. He spends his free time finding and reporting vulnerabilities, recently mostly to Czech companies.\n\n**Session Hijacking on web portal Seznam.cz**\nIn 2020, I have spoken at OWASP Czech Chapter Meeting about Session Hijacking vulnerability on Seznam.cz. In this talk I will show another method of stealing a user's session that I recently found. The talk will be presented in Czech language!\n\nAdditional information\n\n* If using public transportation you can go to the metro station Invalidovna which is a short distance from the office. For cars there are paid parking lots in the street Mol\u00e1kova.\n* There will be some snacks and soft drinks prepared for you during the event!\n* Unless stated otherwise, talks will be in English and the recordings will be available online ( with speakers' permission) after the convention."

Now... Did you ever stop to wonder why? Why are there still supply chain issues with production code, why does phishing still work, why are machines not being patched, why is it that not everything mission critical is protected with 2FA, and why is it seemingly so hard to inventory systems? But this talk actually isn\u2019t about the \"why\", it\u2019s about the \"what\": What we can do to identify and address the root causes and how we can positively influence our own security program. During this presentation we'll take a realistic view into human nature, technical & non-technical controls, and have a conversation about change... for the better."

He was a member of the OWASP Global Conferences committee and lead the organization of 3 OWASP AppSec conferences in Brazil.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferreira/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferreira/)\nTwitter: @lucassapao\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nTitle: **One-Time Quantum-Resistant Fully-Homomorphic Padding Oracle cryptography trends, buzzwords, and snake oil for 2023**\n\nSpeaker:\nDiogo Sousa\n\nAbstract:\nIn our modern times, cryptography is all around us, even if we don't notice it. We use it when checking our bank statements, buying pig plushies online, or sending stickers to each other on instant messengers. Given its ubiquity, it is, for the most part, taken for granted by developers: import HTTP/crypto/TLS, throw in a certificate from Let's Encrypt, and don't think much about it while relying on (hopefully) safe defaults.\nWhile sticking with well-vetted libraries should work out of the box for most cases, in certain areas, you need to be a bit more knowledgeable, if only to make good decisions about what libraries to use and how to wrangle all the moving parts into a cohesive and secure system.\nCryptography tends to be full of obscure notation that isn't that dissimilar to magic spells, and \"Don't Roll Your Own Crypto\" is an often repeated mantra (many times because of the previous statement). Search results for \"crypto\" have been getting progressively more complicated to navigate, with BTC, XRP, and others taking up all the prime SEO result space.\nThis talk targets a beginner to an intermediate audience and, starting from a brief overview of core tenets (Kerckhoffs's principle, Schneier's Law, the economy of mechanism, theoretical vs. practical security), will expand upon the current challenges and trends in modern cryptography, from FHE to PQC (including explaining what those are), and also highlight common design pitfalls (and their consequences) and how to reduce your snake oil intake.\n\nBio:\nAn opinionated individual with interest in cryptography and its intersection with secure software development.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xdsousa/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xdsousa/)"

Learn From Others in the DevOps and DevSecOps Communities\nLook to the DevOps community to help close your critical knowledge gaps.\n2. 2\\. Start With Your Container Security\nThe first step to building out the security of your DevOps toolchain starts with your container security.\n3. Institute Continuous Compliance\nDevSecOps is a platform for continuous compliance to protect your software supply chains against vulnerable packages and vulnerable configurations.\n4. Double Down on Automation\nWhile you may have already been experimenting with automation during your DevOps phase, it only becomes more integral once you throw the switch in by going DevSecOps. Go into your DevOps to DevSecOps transformation with an automation strategy that focuses on automating common developer and sysadmin tasks.\n5. Improve Your Monitoring and Analytics\nBuilding out a DevSecOps toolchain takes your monitoring and analytics options to a new level. Consider the fact that you should already collect and publish data from your toolchain and deliver reports to your project managers, developers, QA testers, and stakeholders outside your team. Commonly, DevOps reporting is still a work in progress for organizations. Use the introduction of new security tools into your toolchain as a chance to offer more granular and real-time security reporting into all parts of your DevSecOps toolchain.\n6. Implement Accessibility Assurance\nDepending on your organization\u2019s definition of compliance, the option is there to add accessibility compliance or Section 508 to your DevSecOps toolchain.\n\nThis hands-on training is reserver for 70% professional and 30% students.\n\nMandatory:\n\nGeneral Conditions in order to validate your participation to this event:\n\n1\\. Student must send University/Student ID\\, otherwise registration will be rejected\\.\n\n2.Professional must register company emails, otherwise registration will be rejected.\n\nRegistration only via EventBrite. We don't accept answer via meetup.\n\nPlease indicate your firstname, lastname, company name, a valid business email or school email (email like gmai, free, hotmail, outlook, etc are not accepted and registration will be cancelled).\n\nPlease register here:\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/billets-devsecops-toolchain-transformation-374188276207"

What are the pitfalls and the solutions? How do we avoid that someone else\u2019s security issues become our security problems? And, by all means, let\u2019s learn how to be a bit lazy, and do better with less effort!\n*Bio:*\nCurrently working as Information Security Manager at Canon EMEA, Sebastian has been in IT and Security for over 20 years, covering a multitude of roles ranging from Developer, Security Architect, Auditor and Consultant, before moving into security governance and management, giving him a unique multi-faceted view on today\u2019s InfoSec challenges. He has led multiple security improvement programs and performed maturity assessments for a wide variety of organizations - while continuously asking himself:\"Could we do this in another way?\"\n\n**About containers and their escapes: understanding escape patterns and possibilities**\n*Abstract:*\nContainers have become one of the most common underlying infrastructure for microservice architectures. As such, they can often be part of the external attack surface of enterprise systems and applications (e.g., whenever a web application hosted on a kubernetes cluster is Internet-facing). Thus, it is important to understand what types of (mis)configurations can make containers more vulnerable against attacks of different types. In this talk, Mauricio will deep dive into different techniques that can be used to escape containers. In particular, he will talk about how to escape privileged containers, the usage of different capabilities, the usage of kernel exploits and a few other ways in which attackers may use to gain access to the hosts of the containers.\n*Bio:*\nMauricio Cano is a cloud pentester focused on container technologies. In particular, he focuses on the security of containers and serverless architectures. He has pentested Kubernetes clusters and serverless architectures for several multinational financial institutions. Prior to his security work, he has a background in academia and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Groningen, focused on programming language design and formal methods to ensure correctness. In his spare time, Cano enjoys reading, cooking, and solving puzzles."

We'll cover everything from the EU directive PSD2 to how to practically secure APIs so that the next time you log in to Vipps, you'll know what's happening behind the scenes!"
