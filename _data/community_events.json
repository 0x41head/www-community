It's a foundational part of building a security culture and uncovers potential security issues before they slip into production.<br/>Proactively protecting data from the app to the API requires modeling potential attacks to mitigate weak points before bad actors find them. A team of 15 security veterans and experts, including Chris Romeo, CEO of Security journey, created the Threat Modeling Manifesto. Chris is a veteran security expert focused on developing a security culture through training and education. During this session, he will discuss why a manifesto, how you can use it as a foundational piece of your threat modeling program, and practical application tips for building an Enterprise-class threat modeling program.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Chris Romeo is CEO and co-founder of Security Journey and is a builder of security culture influencing education. His passion is to bring security culture change to all organizations, large and small, by providing gamified security programs. Chris is a highly rated industry speaker and trainer, featured at RSA Conference, OWASP Global AppSec, and ISC2 Security Congress. Chris was the Chief Security Advocate at Cisco for five years, empowering engineers to shift security left in all products and led Cisco\u2019s security belt program (Cisco Security Ninja). Chris has twenty-three years of security experience, holding positions across the gamut, including application security, security engineering, and incident response. Chris holds the CISSP and CSSLP certifications.

Learn about the latest additions since the last session at OWASP Hamburg Stammtisch, such as:</p> <p>- Coding Challenges<br/>- Cheat Detection<br/>- Challenge Feedback<br/>- Daily Project Stats</p> <p>Warning: This talk will skip any basic intro part in favor more new content!</p> <p>2) Abstract:<br/>----------------<br/>Software updates take an essential role in keeping IT environments secure. If service providers delay or do not install updates, it can cause unwanted security implications for their environments. This paper conducts a large-scale measurement study of the update behavior of websites and their utilized software stacks. Across 18 months, we analyze over 5.6M websites and 246 distinct client-and server-side software distributions. We found that almost all analyzed sites use outdated software. To understand the possible security implications of outdated software, we analyze the potential vulnerabilities that affect the utilized software. We show that software components are getting older and more vulnerable because they are not updated. We find that 95 % of the analyzed websites use at least one product for which a vulnerability existed.</p> <p>Until then: have a great holiday season and all the best for 2022!</p> <p>Cheers, Dirk</p> "

Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs.</p> <p>You may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues.</p> <p>Gartner has actually predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks.</p> <p>This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks. We\u2019ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management .</p> "
