While extensions can be very useful, they come with hidden dangers \u2013 users often prioritise functionality over safety. In this talk, you'll uncover the real risks of using extensions, explore common attacks, and learn about pitfalls. You'll also take a look at some real-life security incidents and what went wrong. You'll leave with a deeper understanding of the need for browser extension security and how to safeguard your browser.\n\n**Bio:** Billy Sheppard is a Bristol-based Senior Application Security Engineer working at Immersive Labs where he creates Secure Code content and challenges for their product.\n\nIn his career thus far, he has earned several achievements including VDP submissions for Fortune 500 companies, Bug bounties, and created and released his own niche CTF/Hacking challenge specifically aimed at increasing security awareness for ServiceNow developers. He has also created a Web Security YouTube Channel to demonstrate security concepts and educate developers and reported multiple real security issues to VDPs/Bug Bounty Programs for large companies such as BBC, RedHat and Accenture. He is a keen learner and spends a lot of his personal time continuously learning and is passionate about education around secure code.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nTalk 2: **An Introduction to scripting for Application Testers,** presented by **Alex Archondakis**.\n\n**Abstract**: Scripting, or the ability to write code that allows you to perform actions or automate repetitive tasks is a crucial tool in any application security testers belt, however, it doesn\u2019t seem to be a common one.\n\nThe purpose of this talk is to introduce scripting to application security testers, this will be achieved by looking at case studies to determine where scripting may be appropriate and how to solve the problem. We will discuss multiple languages and their advantages whilst focussing on interacting with the HTTP protocol.\n\nThe key learning points from this talk are as follows:\n\n* To gain an understanding of the importance of scripting for application security testers\n* What programming languages are used, and their advantages/disadvantages.\n* Typical scenarios where scripting is required because tooling is not comprehensive enough\n\n**Bio**: Alex is head of professional services & a senior consultant at Pentest People. He has a wealth of experience in penetration testing, people management and training hackers. He believes that all application security professionals should be able to write basic scripts to solve common problems."

How to Deploy it\nJoin us for great networking, dinner and drinks, and see a presentation by President and Founder of iSecurePrivacy, LLC.\n\n**ABSTRACT**: Security Architecture is a security design that addresses the technology goals, approaches, controls, and potential for the enterprise. It also specifies when and where to apply security controls. This discussion starts from the enterprise perspective using SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture). It then introduces COBIT, from ISACA, which is a framework that focuses on the governance and management of enterprise IT. TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) aligns security with business needs. Then there is the OWASP SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model) that is a framework for helping organizations analyze their current software security practices in the development of new applications. Within these four security architectures, we will also talk about some software secure coding standards such as (PCI Software Security Framework, SEI CERT Coding Standards, NIST SSDF, Microsoft Secure Coding Guidelines , and OWASP Secure Coding Practices). These standards are important, but they need to be based on meeting the business strategic objectives, business model, and business needs. That is what security architectures provide.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: *[Prisma Cloud](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud)*\n*The Most Complete Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP). Prisma Cloud secures applications from code to cloud, enabling security and DevOps teams to effectively collaborate to accelerate secure cloud-native application development and deployment.*\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available**\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

As the Head of Cybersecurity Services, Octavian brings within Global Delivery Center Romania extensive expertise and a strong track record in managing and delivering Cybersecurity services and solutions.\n\n**Adrian PAUL.** I love information technology, passionate to learn about it, and always looking to put the pieces together. Currently, in the conspicuous role of managing the Cyber Security Engineering team that is in charge of implementation, maintenance and development of multiple security services at Visma. When time permits, I enjoy running and volunteering.\n\n***\\~Security Log Management\\~***\nEnsuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the modern digital enterprise is not an easy task. It involves many parallel and related efforts, from systems engineering to effective cybersecurity policy and comprehensive workforce training. The essential elements in cybersecurity operations are monitoring, analyzing, responding to, and recovering from cyber attacks. Behind the scenes, programs and policies must be put into place to support cybersecurity operations.\n\nOrganizations are starting to use cloud computing to take advantage of its many benefits, including cost savings, quick time-to-market, and on-demand scaling of the environment. To improve security visibility in the cloud, security operations teams will want to develop a continuous monitoring strategy that uses a combination of cloud-native services and third-party options for the Security Log Management solution. The strategy needs to provide the most complete range of coverage for both proactively assessing the environment and detecting unusual events or anomalous behaviour rapidly. Additionally, a Security Log Management focused on automation and machine learning, alongside new and updated types of monitoring, will evolve into a Next-generation Security Information and Event Management (NG-SIEM) solution.\nLogging is a vital part of cybersecurity, as it enables you to detect breaches and identify their source. With a robust Security Log Management solution, you can monitor your environments for unusual activity and take action to stop it before it develops into a full-blown attack. By taking the time to develop a comprehensive logging strategy, you can not only mitigate the potential damage of a cyber attack, but also learn important lessons about how to improve your solution for the future\n\n**Lucian P\u0103tian** is a Cloud Solutions Architect at Haufe Group Timisoara. With a SysAdmin background, for the past four years, he has earned a reputation for finding creative solutions to problems in Cloud.\n\n***\\~ Improving security in AWS Cognito. \\~***\nAbstract: we will discuss about why using the standard configurations in Cognito can make your application a security honeypot. How can you use AWS WAF to add an extra layer of protection and why using verified token attributes should be a must."

It requires a significant investment in people, processes, and technology to achieve the desired business outcomes. The right foundation must be established from the beginning to avoid the high cost of re-architecture, which can be a major roadblock in achieving success. One crucial aspect is developing a standard and scalable security design for their Kubernetes environment. This will establish the framework for implementing the necessary checks, enforcement, and visibility to enable strategic business objectives.\n\nIn conclusion, application modernization is a strategic initiative that can transform businesses.
