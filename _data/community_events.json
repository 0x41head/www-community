And when there are recalls of certain ingredients it\u2019s nice to quickly know whether those ingredients are already in your cupboard. Software Bills of Materials enable you to know what\u2019s in the software you consider procuring, and let you quickly know what\u2019s already inside your organization. Of course, you can even use them to understand the risk in the portfolio of software your organization baked itself! Since the May Executive Order on Improving the Nation\u2019s Cybersecurity SBOMs have gotten a lot more attention, but what does it really mean for an organization to make the most of this capability? This talk will help you prepare your organization for the near future when generating, evaluating, and leveraging SBOMs will be expected.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Greg Mohler is a Manager within KPMG's Cyber Defense practice, and has spent the past four years helping over 20 clients solve difficult problems related to DevSecOps, Application Security, and Vulnerability Management.

Those who haven't already are probably looking to migrating or are already running a hybrid IT environment. With the COVID outbreak there's even a greater demand today enable workers to work from anywhere and forces organizations to integrate cloud solutions quickly. But what about security? In this talk Benjamin will walk you through a brief introduction to the cloud and cloud security components, present common mistakes made in cloud environments and leave you with good cloud security resources and functions available at several cloud providers.<br/>Benjamin Svensson is a IT-security specialist in networking and infrastructure with everal years of experience with security products, penetration testing and network security. Co-founder and organizer of SecurityFest, a technical IT-Security conference on the Swedish West Coast!</p> <p>19:00 - 19:40 #2 Cloud Whisper - Connecting the dots between vulnerabilities and cloud compromises<br/>Running your infrastructure through a cloud provider is nowadays a no brainer, start small and scale to infinity and beyond. We have established the norm of continuous everything, but what effects does this extremely agile way of working have on security? This presentation will take a dive into the deep and often murky waters of common cloud security flaws, introduced by either vulnerabilities within your code base or through cloud misconfiguration. Jesper will showcase ways of exploiting common vulnerability classes that will severely make any DevOps, SysOps day a lot more interesting.<br/>Jesper Larsson is a freelance IT-security specialist and vulnerability researcher penetration tester, focusing on technical infrastructure with a special focus on orchestrations, infrastructure-as-code, deployment pipelines, cloud implementation and integrations. Working for multinational clients spanning several fields and helping companies, foundation entities with implementing secure infrastructure solutions worldwide. Jesper has audited numerous open source projects for a plethora of foundations and companies, such as the CNCF, Mozilla foundation and Linux foundation. Also Jesper is one of the co-founder and organizer of SecurityFest, a technical IT-Security conference on the Swedish West Coast!</p> <p>19:40 - 21:00 Over-Time (Optional)<br/>Let\u00b4s have a couple of beers and continue the discussion around CloudNative! We will try to close down at around 21:00 and we usually go somewhere close to end the night with another beer or two.</p> "

Extensive use is made of open source software such as libraries and frameworks. While this is fantastic from a development point of view (allowing for faster development of applications and features), it does present a potential drawback if not done correctly, an increased risk. Often, we see libraries being used and seldom updated, also we see several libraries being blindly with little to not inspections and reviews. This is gold mine for attackers, there are many ways that they have will continue to use this to their advantage. The purpose of this talk is to cover some of the techniques which attackers could use to exploit open source supply chains. This will include a live demonstration of one such technique which an attacker could used. The talk will then focus on the excellent OWASP Dependency Track tool, showing how this can help reduce the risk to organizations when it comes to dealing with open source packages in software.</p> <p>BIO: Sean Wright is the Lead Application Security SME at Immersive Labs with an origin as a software developer. Primarily focused on web-based application security with a special interest in TLS related subjects. Experienced in providing technical leadership in relation to application security, as well as engaging with teams to improve the security of systems that they develop. Passionate to be a part of the community and giving back to the community. Additionally, enjoy spending personal time performing personal security-related research.</p> <p>Meeting info will be visible to you only if you RSVP for the meeting.</p> <p>ATTENTION SPONSORS: YOUR NAME COULD BE HERE<br/>Check out sponsorship opportunities here<br/><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-los-angeles-chapter-meeting-sponsorship-tickets-30572600471\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-los-angeles-chapter-meeting-sponsorship-tickets-30572600471</a></p> "

Writing secure code is even harder. Serious security vulnerabilities often stem from small programming mistakes. As developers, we can safeguard our applications by catching these mistakes in our own code.</p> <p>Performing a source code review is one of the best ways to find security issues in code. But how do you do it? In this workshop, we will first go through the basics of how to review your code for vulnerabilities and some tactics for performing an effective security code review on your application.</p> <p>But the process of manually analyzing code for vulnerabilities can be very time-consuming. In the second part of this talk, we will also talk about how to use the interactive code analysis tool Joern to make code analysis more efficient. How do you effectively trace user input in code? How can you efficiently link bug sources to sensitive sink functions?

Threat Modelling is an integral part of every company\u2019s Security Development Lifecycle. Still, as development teams grow more prominent, security will have to choose which features they want to Threat Model, or they will become a bottleneck for the development organization.</p> <p>Speaker Biography:</p> <p>Jeevan Singh is an Application Security Engineering Manager for Twilio Segment (<a href=\"https://segment.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://segment.com</a>), where he is embedding security into all aspects of the software development process.

Containers help us to automate our development lifecycle, and businesses across industries are increasingly moving towards this modern way of deploying and managing software.</p> <p>If you are using CI/CD pipelines, you have likely come across containers as part of these pipelines. While there are several different tools that help us build containers, Docker has remained the most popular.</p> <p>But what happens when we have to deal with thousands of containers at a time? This is where container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes come in.</p> <p>In this session, Ana\u00efs will provide an overview of Kubernetes, how it changes our processes around deploying software, its benefits, and how you can get started.</p> <p>ANAIS URLICHS</p> <p>Ana\u00efs is a Site Reliability Engineer at Civo, a cloud computing company based on Kubernetes. When she is not advocating DevOps best practices, she runs her own YouTube Channel centered around cloud-native technologies. Before transitioning to the cloud-native ecosystem, Ana\u00efs helped blockchain projects scale and find adoption. As a CNCF ambassador, her passion lies in making tools and platforms more accessible to developers and community members.</p> <p>Make sure you join us LIVE to get a chance to win a <a href=\"https://kodekloud.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://kodekloud.com/</a> subscription</p> "
