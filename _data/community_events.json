        "description": "We're excited to host Dr. Baljeet Malhotra (Founder/CEO of TeejLab) for a 1 hour session on API Security.\n\nPlease join us for this guest session.\n\nBelow is a talk abstract:\n\nIt is known that 96% of applications are built using some Open Source [Black Duck]. Furthermore, 99% of those Open Source applications contain some Web APIs [TeejLab]. It\u2019s not surprising that Akamai estimated that 83% of the internet traffic today is via Web APIs that connect digital applications at a global scale. The growing API usage impacts organizations both positively (through innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, etc.) and negatively (due to security vulnerabilities, business disruptions, legal and compliance issues etc.). Gartner has predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at enterprises, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs by managing API risks proactively. This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework to manage API security and legal risks. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can adopt for effective API Risk Management. We\u2019ll highlight best practices, both manual and automated, with relevant tool recommendations.\n\nTopic: OWASP Abu Dhabi Chapter: Zero Trust Model for API Security and Legal Risk Management\nTime: Feb 5, 2022 10:00 AM Dubai\n\nJoin Zoom Meeting\nhttps://us06web.zoom.us/j/81688122875?pwd=blFZZXNlbXJja0xlb2NFYkJCcDRBZz09\n\nMeeting ID: 816 8812 2875\nPasscode: 206859\nOne tap mobile\n+13462487799,,81688122875# US (Houston)\n+16699006833,,81688122875# US (San Jose)\n\nDial by your location\n+1 346 248 7799 US (Houston)\n+1 669 900 6833 US (San Jose)\n+1 253 215 8782 US (Tacoma)\n+1 312 626 6799 US (Chicago)\n+1 929 436 2866 US (New York)\n+1 301 715 8592 US (Washington DC)\nMeeting ID: 816 8812 2875\nFind your local number: https://us06web.zoom.us/u/kTeDgNFt4"

Any business with a mobile app, modern web apps (SPAs), using the cloud, doing a digital transformation, integrating with business partners, running microservices or using kubernetes has APIs. There's a good foundation of AppSec knowledge out there - thanks in part to OWASP but API Security isn't exactly the same as AppSec. Additional complexity is part of the landscape with multiple competing API technologies like REST, gRPC and GraphQL plus stakeholders spread across multiple parts of the business. How to do you make sense of API Security landscape? This talk will cover the three fundamental areas to consider, the various chess pieces and the many ways those pieces can be put on your API chessboard. The goal is for you to leave knowing how to map out your API Security landscape and reach a state of solid API Security.\n\nBIO: Matt Tesauro is a DevSecOps and AppSec guru with specialization in creating security programs, leveraging automation to maximize team velocity and training emerging and senior professionals. When not writing automation code in Go, Matt is pushing for DevSecOps everywhere via his involvement in open-source projects, presentations, trainings and new technology innovation.\n\nAs a versatile engineer, Matt\u2019s background spans software development (primarily web development), Linux system administration, penetration testing and application / cloud security. He thrives on tackling technical problems, but his economics background gives him a unique understanding of business constraints and incentives around security initiatives.\n\nCurrently, as a Distinguished Engineer at Noname Security, Matt is evangelizing Noname\u2019s ground-breaking API security platform and API security in general. Previously, he rolled out AppSec automation at USAA and founded 10Security. Early in his career, Matt served as Director of Community and Operations at the OWASP Foundation, Senior AppSec Engineer at Duo Security, Senior Software Security Engineer at Pearson and Senior Product Security Engineer at Rackspace.\n\nMeeting info will be available on meetup - BE SURE TO RSVP to access the link\n\nATTENTION SPONSORS: YOUR NAME COULD BE HERE\nContact sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

Goel\n20:00 - 20:15 Break\n20:15 - 21:00 Gamification of Threat Modelling by Grant Ongers\n\nA story on scaling threat modeling across 500+ DevOps teams.\n\nThis talk is not about \u201cwhat is threat modelling, and what are the different methodologies?\u201d. This is well known and understood by now. With every organization moving towards DevSecOps, the difficult question is \u201chow to do Threat Modeling at scale?\u201d. I want to take this opportunity to share with you the ABN AMRO story about how we did this!\n\nAbhishek k. Goel is a Security Consultant at ABN Amro and the IT lead for Threat Modelling capability at the bank. He is a senior security engineer responsible for enabling security in DevOps across the bank.\nBefore ABN, he was a Lead Security Consultant with Deloitte USI and enabled security in CICD pipelines for clients across the globe.\n\nGamification of Threat Modelling\n\nThe talk is all about doing security architecture and threat modelling work as part of development planning.\nThe presentation starts by introducing OWASP Cornucopia and the simplified OWASP \u201cTop 5\u201d for developers and then moves into looking at how one can practically include a form of threat modelling (using Cornucopia) into one\u2019s agile development practises in an effective manner.\nThere is a brief discussion on gamification, covering the usual FAQs on that and then it moves onto implementation at scale and some of the experiences we\u2019ve had there.\n\nCo-founder of Secure Delivery and current OWASP Global Foundation board member, Grant Ongers (@rewtd), is a firm believer in security enabling delivery not blocking it. The philosophy and purpose of Secure Delivery is in the name: optimal delivery and security in one nimble and adaptive offering.\nGrant\u2019s experience spans Dev - building platforms for Telcos, MSPs and Financial institutions for more than 10 years. 20+ years in Ops, running operational teams in global NOCs to managing mainframe and database systems. He also has over 30 years pushing the limits of (Info)Sec - mostly white-hat. He\u2019s worked on both sides of the TPSA table, for and with regulated orgs ensuring compliance and matching \u201cappetite for\u201d with \u201cacceptance of\u201d risk.\nGrant\u2019s community involvement is global: Staff at BSides (London, Las Vegas, and Cape Town), Goon at DEF CON (USA) for over a decade and DC2721 co-founder, staff at BlackHat (USA and EU).\nAlongside his role as CTO within Secure Delivery, Grant provides C-suite advice and guidance on security to FTSE100 enterprises and strategic risk analysis within M&A diligence teams.\n\nThis is an online meeting and will be streamed on YouTube."

Bring your laptop.\n\nSpeaker: Vickie Li, Developer Evangelist at ShiftLeft\n\nTitle: Analyzing source code for vulnerabilities: A how-to workshop\n\nAbstract:\nWriting code is hard. Writing secure code is even harder. Serious security vulnerabilities often stem from small programming mistakes. As developers, we can safeguard our applications by catching these mistakes in our own code.\n\nPerforming a source code review is one of the best ways to find security issues in code. But how do you do it? In this workshop, we will first go through the basics of how to review your code for vulnerabilities and some tactics for performing an effective security code review on your application.\n\nBut the process of manually analyzing code for vulnerabilities can be very time-consuming. In the second part of this talk, we will also talk about how to use the interactive code analysis tool Joern to make code analysis more efficient. How do you effectively trace user input in code? How can you efficiently link bug sources to sensitive sink functions?"

He is currently working as a senior security consultant in the DevSecOps division of SecurityCompass, Toronto. You probably would have heard Abhi's name from some of his other projects like OWASP Mantra, OWASP Bricks, OWASP TimeGap Theory, TinyBirdCTF, AppSecGames, Attackers and Friends, XSS Train, Exploit-Me REST, Bricktown, and 'Web app security testing with browsers.'\u2028\n\nAbhi is here to launch his latest project, OWASP Snow. It's an open-source tool for defending against shoulder surfing. Think of Snow as 'a software version of the privacy screen protector.' Spoiler alert - If you are curious and want to give Snow a try before the session, here is the link - https://privacysnow.com/\u2028\n\nNo technical knowledge is required to attend this session. It will be a defensive security session; please do not expect 0-days.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOn The Many Habitats, Hiding Places, and Known Camouflages of Apache Log4J (6:45-7:45pm)\nBy: Julius Musseau\n\nVulnerable Log4J versions should be easy to identify, right? There are only 30 published versions of Log4J that are actually vulnerable to the incredible CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability. How hard can it be to identify (and exterminate!) versions of this mischievous Java library on our file systems? In this talk Julius will show how things are not quite as simple as one would hope, and how Log4J can come in many different shapes and forms, defeating scan and identification attempts. He will also show the vulnerability in action, and show how he determined that Bitbucket was not vulnerable despite the presence of the bad Jar file.\n\nSpeaker Bio: Julius Musseau has long been obsessed with Java Jar files. He was the primary author on a 40 page academic journal article all about identifying Jar files (\u201cSoftware Bertillonage\u201d)! In the last 4 years Julius has worked as co-founder and CTO at MergeBase, a Vancouver based application-security company devoted to Jar files, NPM files, DLL files, Ruby Gem Files, Elixir Mix files, etc. As you can see, Julius has really branched out lately ! Julius is the author of a leading Log4J detector: https://github.com/mergebase/log4j-detector"
