We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.\" The Internet of today is an amazing place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr. Barlow's original vision.\n\nIn the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis, state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars. We must be free to communicate and associate without fear. To realize our right to privacy and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions. CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to privacy and anonymity online. Topics include technologies like TOR, full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more. CryptoParties are free to attend, public, and not commercially aligned.\n\nPresenter:\nJosh Sokol\n\nAnd others. Please email josh.sokol@owasp.org if you have a 10 minute max presentation on a crypto-oriented subject."

This is done through mini-discussions, demos, presentations, and series of meetings to cover more involved topics (i.e. book topics). Generally the topics will be participant-led, meaning that attendees will volunteer their time to present or lead a discussion, whether a one-time presentation of a topic they wish to review or need help with, or walk through topics of a particular chapter of a book being covered. There will still be OWASP leadership involved with scheduling and such, but the idea is to get a better \u201chands-on\u201d approach to create a more productive learning environment. We learn more when we are involved.\n\nMore information: https://owasp.org/www-chapter-austin/studygroups.html"

It's a foundational part of building a security culture and uncovers potential security issues before they slip into production.\nProactively protecting data from the app to the API requires modeling potential attacks to mitigate weak points before bad actors find them. A team of 15 security veterans and experts, including Chris Romeo, CEO of Security journey, created the Threat Modeling Manifesto. Chris is a veteran security expert focused on developing a security culture through training and education. During this session, he will discuss why a manifesto, how you can use it as a foundational piece of your threat modeling program, and practical application tips for building an Enterprise-class threat modeling program.\n\nBio:\n\nChris Romeo is CEO and co-founder of Security Journey and is a builder of security culture influencing education. His passion is to bring security culture change to all organizations, large and small, by providing gamified security programs. Chris is a highly rated industry speaker and trainer, featured at RSA Conference, OWASP Global AppSec, and ISC2 Security Congress. Chris was the Chief Security Advocate at Cisco for five years, empowering engineers to shift security left in all products and led Cisco\u2019s security belt program (Cisco Security Ninja). Chris has twenty-three years of security experience, holding positions across the gamut, including application security, security engineering, and incident response. Chris holds the CISSP and CSSLP certifications. For more information, see https://www.linkedin.com/in/securityjourney/\nTo book Chris for you event, please contact speaking@securityjourney.com."

        "description": "Happy new year everyone!\n\nOn Thursday the 13th we present online a series of lightning talks in English language.\n\nWe'll start with a topic which was hot in December and still may cause headaches. This is followed by broad research and we finalize the talk section with the almost mandatory report ;-) on what's new about Juice Shop 13. Any similarity of our date and the Juice Shop version is pure coincidence. ;-)\n\nYou're welcome to stay a bit longer after the talks for some networking.\n\nTalks\n=====\n\n1) Thomas Patzke: \"Honeypotting Log4Shell Exploitation Attempts\"\n2) Nurullah Demir: \"Our (in)Secure Web: Understanding Update\nBehavior of Websites and Its Impact on Security\"\n3) Bj\u00f6rn Kimminich: Juice Shop 13: Now with Coding Challenges!\"\n\n1) Abstract: Honeypotting Log4Shell\n--------------------------------------------------\nThe vulnerability CVE-2021-44228 in Log4j (also known as Log4Shell) was disclosed on 2021-12-09. It allows remote code execution with a simple exploit and the vulnerable library Log4j has a high prevalence in many applications. Almost immediately threat actors, researchers, bounty hunters and others started to scan the Internet for vulnerable hosts and some exploited them to gain access to IT environments, deploy coin miners or extend botnets.\n\nIn this talk Thomas will give an overview about Log4Pot, a honeypot developed by various members of the security community to gather data from the exploitation attempts. He will show how the raw data can be turned into insights that are valuable for defenders and how this can be used to detect vulnerable hosts. We will look on real data and see how attackers changed their exploitation attempts and techniques over time. Further, he'll also share some lessons learned while running the honeypot instances.\n\n2) Abstract: Update Behavior of Websites\n---------------------------------------------------------\nSoftware updates take an essential role in keeping IT environments secure. If service providers delay or do not install updates, it can cause unwanted security implications for their environments. This paper conducts a large-scale measurement study of the update behavior of websites and their utilized software stacks. Across 18 months, we analyze over 5.6M websites and 246 distinct client-and server-side software distributions. We found that almost all analyzed sites use outdated software. To understand the possible security implications of outdated software, we analyzed the potential vulnerabilities that affect the utilized software. We show that software components are getting older and more vulnerable because they are not updated. We find that 95 % of the analyzed websites use at least one product for which a vulnerability existed.\n\n3) Abstract: Juice Shop 13\n------------------------------------\nOWASP Juice Shop 13.x has some juicy new features which will be tough to squeeze into a mini-talk, but let's do it anyway! Learn about the latest additions since the last session at OWASP Hamburg Stammtisch, such as:\n\n- Coding Challenges\n- Cheat Detection\n- Challenge Feedback\n- Daily Project Stats\n\nWarning: This talk will skip any basic intro part in favor more new content!\n\nHow to participate\n==================\nOWASP Hamburg Meetup members who RSVP'd for the event will see the URL at the RHS and can join the video conference directly. I'll update the invite URL 1 or 2 days before. The one which matches TBD is not the final one. Just need a password too which you find here. Please make sure when joining you are muted by default to avoid background noise. You're cordially invited to stay longer for socializing, discussion and have e.g. a beer.\n\nOur OWASP \"Stammtisch\"\n=========================\nOur meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pentesters and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information.\n\nFeel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too. Participation is free and open -- as the O in OWASP.\n\nCheers, Dirk"

        "description": "Web applications are prone to various cybersecurity risks. Did you know that 96% of these web applications contain some Open Source? Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs.\n\nYou may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues.\n\nGartner has actually predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks.\n\nThis session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks. We\u2019ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management ."
