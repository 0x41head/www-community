        "description": "We're excited to host Dr. Baljeet Malhotra (Founder/CEO of TeejLab) for a 1 hour session on API Security.\n\nPlease join us for this guest session.\n\nBelow is a talk abstract:\n\nIt is known that 96% of applications are built using some Open Source [Black Duck]. Furthermore, 99% of those Open Source applications contain some Web APIs [TeejLab]. It\u2019s not surprising that Akamai estimated that 83% of the internet traffic today is via Web APIs that connect digital applications at a global scale. The growing API usage impacts organizations both positively (through innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, etc.) and negatively (due to security vulnerabilities, business disruptions, legal and compliance issues etc.). Gartner has predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at enterprises, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs by managing API risks proactively. This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework to manage API security and legal risks. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can adopt for effective API Risk Management. We\u2019ll highlight best practices, both manual and automated, with relevant tool recommendations.\n\nTopic: OWASP Abu Dhabi Chapter: Zero Trust Model for API Security and Legal Risk Management\nTime: Feb 5, 2022 10:00 AM Dubai"

Did you know that 96% of these web applications contain some Open Source? Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs. You may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues. Gartner has actually predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks.

Your company literally can scale at the click of a button. But if you take the simplicity of the cloud for granted, you wind up with brittle security that even a novice adversary can overcome. This talk will focus on identifying the holes in your cloud application before the attackers do, closing those gaps, and building architectures that can withstand the barrage of attacks that the Internet will throw at it.\n\nBio:\n\nJosh Sokol, CISSP, graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BS in Computer Science in 2002. Since that time, he has worked for several large companies, including AMD and BearingPoint, spent some time as a military contractor, and recently left a ten year career as the Information Security Program Owner at National Instruments in order to pursue a full-time role as the Creator, CEO, and CISO of the free and open source risk management tool named SimpleRisk. Josh has spoken on dozens of security topics, including the much-hyped \u201cHTTPSCan Byte Me\u201d talk at Black Hat 2010, and served for four years on the OWASP Global Board of Directors."

Bring your laptop.\n\nSpeaker: Vickie Li, Developer Evangelist at ShiftLeft\n\nTitle: Analyzing source code for vulnerabilities: A how-to workshop\n\nAbstract:\nWriting code is hard. Writing secure code is even harder. Serious security vulnerabilities often stem from small programming mistakes. As developers, we can safeguard our applications by catching these mistakes in our own code.\n\nPerforming a source code review is one of the best ways to find security issues in code. But how do you do it? In this workshop, we will first go through the basics of how to review your code for vulnerabilities and some tactics for performing an effective security code review on your application.\n\nBut the process of manually analyzing code for vulnerabilities can be very time-consuming. In the second part of this talk, we will also talk about how to use the interactive code analysis tool Joern to make code analysis more efficient. How do you effectively trace user input in code? How can you efficiently link bug sources to sensitive sink functions?"

Any business with a mobile app, modern web apps (SPAs), using the cloud, doing a digital transformation, integrating with business partners, running microservices or using kubernetes has APIs. There's a good foundation of AppSec knowledge out there - thanks in part to OWASP but API Security isn't exactly the same as AppSec. Additional complexity is part of the landscape with multiple competing API technologies like REST, gRPC and GraphQL plus stakeholders spread across multiple parts of the business. How to do you make sense of API Security landscape? This talk will cover the three fundamental areas to consider, the various chess pieces and the many ways those pieces can be put on your API chessboard. The goal is for you to leave knowing how to map out your API Security landscape and reach a state of solid API Security.\n\nBIO: Matt Tesauro is a DevSecOps and AppSec guru with specialization in creating security programs, leveraging automation to maximize team velocity and training emerging and senior professionals. When not writing automation code in Go, Matt is pushing for DevSecOps everywhere via his involvement in open-source projects, presentations, trainings and new technology innovation.\n\nAs a versatile engineer, Matt\u2019s background spans software development (primarily web development), Linux system administration, penetration testing and application / cloud security. He thrives on tackling technical problems, but his economics background gives him a unique understanding of business constraints and incentives around security initiatives.\n\nCurrently, as a Distinguished Engineer at Noname Security, Matt is evangelizing Noname\u2019s ground-breaking API security platform and API security in general. Previously, he rolled out AppSec automation at USAA and founded 10Security. Early in his career, Matt served as Director of Community and Operations at the OWASP Foundation, Senior AppSec Engineer at Duo Security, Senior Software Security Engineer at Pearson and Senior Product Security Engineer at Rackspace.\n\nMeeting info will be available on meetup - BE SURE TO RSVP to access the link\n\nATTENTION SPONSORS: YOUR NAME COULD BE HERE\nContact sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

In fact, web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet.This growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks.\n\nIn this session, Dr Baljeet Malhotra will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks. He\u2019ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management.\n\nAPIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, and competitive differentiation, but their weak security posture leads to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues. Gartner has actually predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications.\n\nGiven the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks.\n\nDr Baljeet Malhotra, is an award-winning researcher known for his work in Open Source and API Data Management. He conceptualized the world's first \"API Composition Analysis\" based on source code static analysis.

He found a class of issues in Python. It\u2019s hard to tell how bad it is: one person said \u201cI hope you\u2019re wrong\u201d and one said, \u201cWow. What. A. Mess.\u201d But when it comes down to it, he found a very difficult to diagnose class of logic-flaws, the existence of which is even harder to test for safely. Thankfully, Python is only mainly used for scientific, academic, back-end and monetary systems\u2026 right? Right.\n\nBIO: Robert Hansen is a 27-year veteran in computer security, known to many in the industry by handle \"RSnake\". Robert started his career at eBay, where he was responsible for authentication as well as most anti-fraud systems and anti-phishing technologies. His work at eBay was later built into every modern web browser and is now protecting every Internet user as a result. His site, ha.ckers.org, was at one point responsible for a third of all the top-ranked web vulnerabilities when it was live.\n\nAt SecTheory he hacked into the back ends of over 2,100 banks, credit card processors, flight control systems, SCADA (water and power) control systems, and other security companies. During this time, Robert also built the most secure web application security hosting platform in the world at Falling Rock Networks, surviving over 15 million attacks in 8 years.\n\nMost recently, Robert's corporate intelligence platform, OutsideIntel, was acquired by Bit Discovery after which he became the CTO. Robert has worked as a floating CISO for multiple companies and sits on advisory boards of multiple technology and security companies such as Arkose Labs.\n\nMeeting info will be available on meetup - BE SURE TO RSVP to access the link\n\nATTENTION SPONSORS: YOUR NAME COULD BE HERE\nContact sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

He also championed an industry-wide initiative to get all major artifact servers in the JVM ecosystem to formally decommission the support of HTTP in favor of HTTPS only. In his free time, he contributes to OSS by finding and reporting security vulnerabilities to popular OSS projects.
