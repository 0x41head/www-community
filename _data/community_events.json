Extensive use is made of open source software such as libraries and frameworks. While this is fantastic from a development point of view (allowing for faster development of applications and features), it does present a potential drawback if not done correctly, an increased risk. Often, we see libraries being used and seldom updated, also we see several libraries being blindly with little to not inspections and reviews. This is gold mine for attackers, there are many ways that they have will continue to use this to their advantage. The purpose of this talk is to cover some of the techniques which attackers could use to exploit open source supply chains. This will include a live demonstration of one such technique which an attacker could used. The talk will then focus on the excellent OWASP Dependency Track tool, showing how this can help reduce the risk to organizations when it comes to dealing with open source packages in software.</p> <p>BIO: Sean Wright is the Lead Application Security SME at Immersive Labs with an origin as a software developer. Primarily focused on web-based application security with a special interest in TLS related subjects. Experienced in providing technical leadership in relation to application security, as well as engaging with teams to improve the security of systems that they develop. Passionate to be a part of the community and giving back to the community. Additionally, enjoy spending personal time performing personal security-related research.</p> <p>Meeting info will be visible to you only if you RSVP for the meeting.</p> <p>ATTENTION SPONSORS: YOUR NAME COULD BE HERE<br/>Check out sponsorship opportunities here<br/><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-los-angeles-chapter-meeting-sponsorship-tickets-30572600471\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-los-angeles-chapter-meeting-sponsorship-tickets-30572600471</a></p> "

We will be focusing on:</p> <p>- Refactoring of the requirements in the MASVS<br/>- Refactoring of the test cases in the MSTG<br/>- Automation opportunities<br/>- New document structure for the MSTG<br/>- Plans for long-term maintainability of the MSTG<br/>- Revisiting the mobile attack surface<br/>- Sharing ideas about rule-based dynamic analysis</p> <p>and many other things.</p> <p>Bio - Authors of the MSTG and MASVS<br/>[[ Carlos ]]<br/>Carlos is a mobile security research engineer with NowSecure who has gained many years of hands-on experience in the field of security testing for mobile apps and embedded systems such as automotive control units and IoT devices. He is passionate about reverse engineering and dynamic instrumentation of mobile apps and is continuously learning and sharing his knowledge.</p> <p>[[ Sven ]]<br/>Sven is the Technical Director of F-Secure Singapore and has hands-on experience in attacking and defending web and mobile apps for the last 10+ years. He is giving talks and workshops about Mobile Security worldwide to different audiences, ranging from developers to students and penetration testers.</p> <p>Cracking Android PINs<br/>---------------------------------------------<br/>What if I told you that in 2021 you could still brute-force the PIN on an Android phone?</p> <p>I will show you how to turn your Kali Nethunter phone into a brute-force PIN cracking machine. Unlike other methods this works on phones out of the box, so you won't need ADB access to your locked phone, or to have previously rooted the Operating System. While not every phone is vulnerable, many are, and the version of Android doesn't matter. Although Android itself is reasonable secure, each handset manufacturer has made their own lock-screen with custom brute-force protection and some of them are easily cracked.</p> <p>Bio<br/>[[ Andrew Horton ]]<br/>Andrew Horton aka urbanadventurer has been in the information security space for over 10 years.

If you are launching a microservice into a Kubernetes cluster, or even building an entire AWS virtual infrastructure, IaC can automate the deployment. By building repeatable templates you can also ensure that deployments happen exactly as you design, every time. However, errors in infrastructure configuration are now regarded as the second biggest cause of data breaches. There are many ways to give adversaries an advantage through security misconfigurations. Overly permissive storage volumes, unauthenticated database access, or ports left open to the internet have all been a cause of compromise. The solution? Treat your infrastructure code the same as your application code. During your build process, use tools to scan for infrastructure misconfigurations. When you find them raise alerts or even break the build.</p> <p>In this session, we will discuss common types of IaC misconfigurations, and demonstrate a free, open-source security tool that developers can build into their pipelines to help protect infrastructure from compromise.</p> <p>About Ori Bendet:</p> <p>An experienced product leader combining strong technical and marketing skills, Ori has been leading Checkmarx's flagship product, CxSAST (Static Application Security Testing), a Gartner and Forrester market-leading solution, serving thousands of customers worldwide for the last 2 years.

He's an open so(u)rcerer and has built or contributed to a wide variety of security tools, both offensive and defensive. This talk is discussing both positive and negative phenomenom around a web fuzzing tool he built and maintains: ffuf, or: \"fuzz faster u fool\".</p> <p>~*FFUF - Fuzz Faster, U're ***ed ... The good, the bad and the ugly of web fuzzing~<br/>Abstract: Web fuzzing is a powerful method for automating the boring tasks in both black box, and gray box testing of web applications. There's only so much one can do when approaching this kind of target manually but with proper tooling the server resources are the only limit. Wait? Server resources being the limit?</p> <p>Penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, security researchers and criminals are using the same techniques for different purposes. What happens when you are able to send tens of thousands of requests from your laptop, over the internet to a target. What if you scale it up horizontally, doing the same thing from hundreds of sources? What if the responding endpoint is intentionally slow - a login for example?</p> <p>At the cloud-native age, rate limiting might seem as an ancient thing from a distant past but for the very same reasons it's more relevant than ever...</p> "

        "description": "<p>LIGHTNING TALK<br/>------------------------</p> <p>G0rking \u2013 Google dorking made easy</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>The presentation will cover briefly what google dorking is, then I will proceed with what is an OWASP project, how one can contribute, how to find various OWASP project, and one or two examples of G0rking usage</p> <p>Presenter:</p> <p>Ignatius Asikin</p> <p>Ignatius is a Senior consultant who specializes in offensive security. Aside from offensive security practices, Ignatius has also led numerous cyber maturity assessment engagements, architecture review, and is currently an instructor at Seneca College.</p> <p>TALK<br/>-------</p> <p>Software Composition Analysis 101: Knowing what\u2019s inside your apps</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>The term Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is relatively new to the security world. However, similar approaches have been used since the early 2000s to indicate security verifications on open source components. SCA has become an evolution of that. It is the process of identifying and listing all the components and versions present in the code and checking each specific service and looking for outdated or vulnerable libraries that may impose security risks to the application. These tools can also check for legal issues regarding the use of open-source software with different licensing terms and conditions. Nevertheless, how those SCA tools work, and how can they help identify and remediate issues on open source libraries used in a codebase? This talk aims to focus on and explain to the audience by showing how these tools work and the main pieces of information that these tools rely on, such as the application manifest, vulnerability data sources, and dependency metadata.</p> <p>Audience Takeaways<br/>SCA tools and techniques are here to stay, and their usage is increasing in many organizations where security is a priority. Unfortunately, AppSec teams cannot keep up with all the new vulnerabilities published daily. Make sure to look for solutions that can adequately adapt to your own way of building software. They need to cover the programming languages used in your organization and identify issues on indirect dependencies, not just relying on public CVEs to find those issues.</p> <p>Presenter:</p> <p>Magno Logan works as an Information Security Specialist for Trend Micro. He specializes in Cloud, Container and Application Security Research, Threat Modelling and Red Teaming. He has been tapped as a resource speaker for numerous security conferences around the globe. He is also a member of the CNCF SIG-Security team</p> "

Join us for an evening of threat modelling!</p> <p>Visit our OWASP Chapter to learn more about us at:<br/><a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-chapter-victoria/\" class=\"linkified\">https://owasp.org/www-chapter-victoria/</a></p> <p>Speaker: Jeevan Singh<br/>Presentation: Talk, Q&amp;A, and accompanying workshop</p> <p>Event Details:</p> <p>Threat Modelling is a great way to discover and remediate threats in your system before they are even created. Security professionals commonly perform it, but anyone can do threat modelling. This hands-on workshop will cover the threat modelling workflow, common classes of vulnerabilities, and hands-on examples that will have *you* discover threats in different systems. Threat Modelling is an integral part of every company\u2019s Security Development Lifecycle. Still, as development teams grow more prominent, security will have to choose which features they want to Threat Model, or they will become a bottleneck for the development organization.</p> <p>Speaker Biography:</p> <p>Jeevan Singh is an Application Security Engineering Manager for Twilio Segment (<a href=\"https://segment.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://segment.com</a>), where he is embedding security into all aspects of the software development process. Jeevan enjoys building a security culture within organizations and educating staff on security best practices. Jeevan is responsible for a wide variety of tasks, including architecting security solutions, working with development teams to resolve security vulnerabilities, and building out security features. Before life in the security space, Jeevan had a wide variety of development and leadership roles over the past 15 years.</p> "
