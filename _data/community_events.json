At Telstra, Manual Secure Code Review is a great complement to the existing automated reviews using SAST and SCA technology. While the automated tools improve the scale and automation of security reviews, bugs still slip through the cracks and often times the tools just don't meet the expectations of either security folk or the developers they work with. Cole will be covering why Manual reviews are used, what the value they provide over a fully automated pipeline is, and how to perform your first one.</p> "

Working in the tech industry often involves spending long hours sitting down, staring at a screen, consuming copious amounts of pizza and caffeine. The work is mentally demanding and can be stressful. In the rush to get everything done, it can be easy to neglect our health. But a healthy body and mind are necessary for effective performance. Based on HR training, research, and personal experience, this session provides realistic suggestions for managing your well-being at work. It covers the connection between physical and mental health, as well as how to discuss these topics with your employer. You\u2019ll leave with a better idea of how to take care of yourself and be a happier, healthier, and more productive person.</p> <p>Bio: Cassandra Faris is passionate about the human side of technology.

However all is not lost, this talk will focus on 10 lessons that can be applied to your job (no matter what it is as long as its InfoSec related) that will help you do it better, stronger, faster etc\u2026Providing information on topics such as: why does no one ever give me the funding I want and how do I get it? How can I do a useful penetration test? How do I build an effective security program that makes my job security &gt; 2 years? And How do bad guys really think and how do I do that? Drawing on personal experience and other sources this talk will provide concrete things you can actually do to keep the organisations we work for secure, not lose our minds, and hopefully navigate the crazy.</p> <p>SPEAKERS:</p> <p>MIRIAM WIESNER (@miriamxyra)</p> <p>Miriam Wiesner is a Senior Security Program Manager for Microsoft Defender ATP.

Originally beginning his interest in security after watching war-games and deciding that \u201cbreaking into computers looks fun\u201d he then proceeded to hack things from the age of 11.

But it is often ignored due to high cost / time investment of classic approaches. Instead, I will show how to use a lightweight value-driven approach to embed security right into the agile design process. No more top-heavy, big-model-up-front threat modeling that security pros love!</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Avi D is the CEO of Bounce Security, a boutique consultancy focusing on high-impact software security. I am obsessed with maximizing value output from security efforts. I have been designing, developing, and testing secure applications for over 20 years. I am a frequent trainer and speaker at industry conferences, such as OWASP, RSA, BSides, and InfoSec, as well as developer conferences such as NDC, DevSecCon, PyCon, and DevOpsDays. I\u2019ve trained thousands of developers on security, including secure coding, security architecture, threat modeling, and more.

We've spent decades struggling to verify software from the outside by analyzing the source code, scanning, fuzzing, pentesting, etc... But we can get INSIDE the box and directly measure the security of software while it's running (in development, test, and even production). In this talk, you'll learn about Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) and also Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP). You\u2019ll learn how to use the free and open source Java Observability Toolkit (JOT) project to easily create your own powerful security instrumentation without coding. We\u2019ll analyze security defenses, identify complex vulnerabilities, create custom sandboxes, and enforce policy at runtime. Ultimately, IAST and RASP enable Dev, Sec, and Ops teams to work together in harmony, so your teams can focus on delivering value at high velocity.</p> <p>Speaker's Bio: Jeff brings more than 20 years of security leadership experience as co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Contrast Security. Previously, Jeff was co-founder and CEO of Aspect Security, a successful and innovative application security consulting company acquired by EY. Jeff is also a founder and major contributor to OWASP, where he served as Global Chairman for 10 years, and created the OWASP Top 10, OWASP Enterprise Security API, OWASP Application Security Verification Standard, XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet, and many more popular open source projects. Jeff has a BA from Virginia, an MA from George Mason, and a JD from Georgetown.

        "description": "<p>The repetitive nature of response tasks is one of the biggest causes of fatigue and burnout among Incident Responders. Anyone who\u2019s been on-call on a Security team can remember how many hours they\u2019ve spent opening the same tabs, clicking the same buttons, copy+pasting the same indicator data and performing other similar tasks repeatedly. Imagine if that time was spent building stronger detection capabilities instead, or even better, on taking a break from the screen and going out for a walk!</p> <p>While this issue can be solved by outsourcing the frontline response capabilities, it is costly in terms of time and money to identify a proficient vendor, obtain approvals, finalize the contract, and pay for the service...</p> <p>What if I told you that at Segment, we built this capability with an open-source tool in the same amount of time it would take a team to do all of the above, with the time and resources of a single full-time security engineer? Welcome to the story of our Response Automation journey!</p> <p>OUR SPEAKER</p> <p>Prima Virani</p> <p>Prima is a seasoned Security professional who has worked in a variety of industries such as Consumer Tech, Oil &amp; Gas, Media, and Fin-tech. She is a Senior Engineer on SIRT at Segment where she enjoys creating tooling for Incident Detection &amp; Response and occasionally dabbles in Security DevOps. She loves sharing her experiences with the industry and has spoken at many meetups and conferences globally including, but not limited to, Agile India 2020, MacDevOpsCon Vancouver 2019, Grace Hopper Conference 2017.</p> "
