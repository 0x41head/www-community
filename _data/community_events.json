Please reach out if the event gets full and I will add room for more people.\n\n**19:00 - 19:10 \u2013 \"Welcome\" by OWASP Chapter Aarhus**\n\n**19:10 - 19:55 \u2013 \"Let's Write Security Unit Tests\" by Eric Johnson, Principal Security Engineer at Puma Security and SANS Senior Instructor**\n\nAbout the presentation:\nDevOps teams are test obsessed, often leveraging unit testing frameworks and continuous integration (CI) tools to automate test requirements. In this talk, we will explore how security unit testing fits into DevOps, a few unit testing frameworks, and several examples that can help security teams harden their applications. Live demonstrations will show how to write security unit tests, execute the tests in a GitHub Actions workflow, and evaluate the test results.\n\nAbout the presenter:\nEric Johnson is co-founder and Principal Security Engineer at Puma Security focusing on cloud security, static code analysis, and DevSecOps automation. His experience includes performing cloud security reviews, infrastructure as code automation, application security automation, web and mobile application penetration testing, secure development lifecycle consulting, and secure code review assessments. Eric is a Senior Instructor with the SANS Institute where he authors information security courses on cloud security, DevSecOps automation, and secure coding. He delivers security training globally for SANS, as well as presents security research at conferences including RSA, BlackHat, OWASP, BSides, DevOpsDays, fwd:cloudsec, and ISSA.\n\n**19:55 \u2013 20:05 \u2013 Short break**\n\n**20:05 \u2013 20:55 \u2013 \u201cA Fully Trained Jedi, You Are Not\u201d by Adam Shostack, President, Shostack + Associates**\n\nAbout the presentation:\nAs software organizations try to bring security earlier in the development processes, what can or should regular software or operations engineers know about security? Taking as given that we want them to build secure systems, that demands a shared understanding of the security issues that might come up, and agreement on what that body of knowledge might entail. Without this knowledge, they'll keep building insecure systems. With them, we can have fewer recurring problems that are trivially attackable.\n\nAbout the presenter:\nAdam is a leading expert on threat modeling, and a consultant, author and game designer. He has decades of experience delivering security. His experience ranges across the business world from founding startups to nearly a decade at Microsoft. He helped to create the CVE, serves on the Blackhat Review Board, and is an affiliate professor at the University of Washington.\n\n**20:55 \u2013 21:00 - \"Closing notes and Goodbyes\" by OWASP Chapter Aarhus**"

Did you know that 96% of these web applications contain some Open Source? Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs. You may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues. Gartner has actually predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks. This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks. We\u2019ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management.\n\n**Speaker: Dr. Baljeet Malhotra**\nDr. Baljeet Malhotra, is an award-winning researcher known for his work in Open Source and API Data Management. He conceptualized the world's first \"API Composition Analysis\" based on source code static analysis. He founded TeejLab in 2017 and steered the team to build API Discovery and Security\u2122, world's first comprehensive end-to-end API Management platform. Prior to TeejLab, he established the R&D unit of Black Duck Software in 2016 (acquired by Synopsys), he has also served as Research Director at SAP. He received a PhD in Computing Science from the University of Alberta and won several awards including NSERC (Canada) scholar in 2005 and Global Young Scientist (Singapore). He concurrently holds Adjunct Professor positions at the University of British Columbia, University of Victoria and University of Northern BC.\n\nRSVP for in-person:\nhttps://owasp-austin-2023-march.eventbrite.com Eventbrite(in-person)"

But the sun is shining again, so here we go ;-)\n\nWe\u00b4d like to invite you to the next (online) meeting which fits into the previous WAF topics we had. Thus I am glad we\u00b4ll have Felipe and Juan Pablo as our guests presenting us a modern approach to an Open-Source WAF: Coraza. Coraza is a a new OWASP project, currently in lab status. It's written in Go, supports ModSecurity SecLang rulesets and is 100% compatible with the OWASP Core Rule Set.\n\nWe'll start @ 3pm as there's a time difference to where the speaker's are joining us from.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nLocation: Online\nStart: 24th of March, 3pm CET (10 am EST)\nTitle: The way to WAF in 2023 [online]\nSpeakers: [Felipe Zipitria](https://owasp2023globalappsecdublin.sched.com/speaker/felipezipitria), [Juan Pablo Tosso](https://owasp2023globalappsecdublin.sched.com/speaker/jptosso)\nNetworking: Stick around afterwards a bit if you like.\n\nAbstract\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nWe are fighting a 2023 problem by using early 2000s technology. The web has evolved. Therefore, the threats have evolved, SQL injection isn\u2019t as common as it used to be, and attackers are now looking for more complex vulnerabilities that could provide faster and bigger profits. New technologies also come with new architecture and deployment requirements, so the final question becomes, how can we protect our applications without risking false positives or decreasing performance? OWASP Coraza\u2019s goal is to solve these questions by providing a modern approach to Open-Source WAF using Golang. Coraza provides a modular, fast, developer-friendly, and efficient set of WAF capabilities that can be easily integrated into any program, it also provides connectors for Web Servers, API Gateways, HTTP frameworks, and more. Coraza is 100% compatible with OWASP Core Ruleset and extends ModSecurity capabilities to the 2020s internet.\n\nProject Links:\n[https://www.coraza.io/](https://www.coraza.io/)\n[https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza](https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza)\n[https://owasp.org/www-project-coraza-web-application-firewall/](https://owasp.org/www-project-coraza-web-application-firewall/)\n\nBios\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nFelipe has over 15 years of experience in the information security field. He regularly trains professionals from different backgrounds in application security, cloud security, and information security. He is a lecturer on Computer Security Foundations for graduates and Application Security for postgraduates at the local University where he lives, in Montevideo - Uruguay. He holds an MSc in Computer Security from the same University, UDELAR. Felipe also has contributed to the OWASP mission as a co-leader of the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set Flagship project, the OWASP Coraza WAF project, and previously as Uruguay Chapter Leader.\n\nJuan is a cybersecurity researcher from Chile. He enjoys writing open-source code, hiking, biking, spending time with his children, traveling, writing, and reading. He used to be a white hat hacker, but now turned to the blue side. He is the founder and project leader of the OWASP Coraza WAF project.\n\nHow to participate\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nOWASP Hamburg Meetup members who rsvp'd for the event will see the URL at the RHS and can join the video conference directly.\nPlease make sure when the talk starts your video is off and you are muted.\nWe\u00b4ll be guest of senfcall (a german membership corporation) which provides us with a privacy friendly video conference facility. Thank you!\n\nOur OWASP \"Stammtisch\"\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nOur meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pen testers and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information.\n\nFeel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too. Participation is free and open -- as the O in OWASP.\n\nCheers, Dirk\n\nPS: Outlook: Next meetings we'll present a new OWASP project -- OWASP Raider and a cool introduction into Rust. We plan both as hybrid sessions, OWASP Raider will be in English."

Not only are two major releases in the pipeline (5.0 and 2.0 respectively) but we are now seeing industry stand up, take notice and start expecting more from applications, based on these standards. In this talk, Josh Grossman (one of the ASVS project leaders) will take you through these key developments including our vision for the upcoming version 5.0 of the ASVS and how you and your employer can be involved in the final release.\nThis will also be a chance to hear first-hand about a couple of new programmes where you will see the SVSs being more widely used and required and how you can prepare your organizations for this significant impact this will have, whether you are developing applications or you are assessing them.\n\n*Bio:*\nJosh Grossman has worked as a consultant in IT and Application Security and Risk for 15 years now, as well as a Software Developer. This has given him an in-depth understanding of how to manage the balance between business needs, developer needs and security needs which goes into a successful software security programme.\n\nJosh is currently CTO for Bounce Security where he helps clients improve and get better value from their application security processes and provides specialist application security advice. His consultancy work has led him to work, speak and deliver training both locally and worldwide including privately for ISACA and Manicode and publicly for OWASP's Global AppSec conferences. In his spare time, he co-leads the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard project and is on the OWASP Israel chapter board.\n\nHe was also recognized as a Key Contributor for the OWASP Proactive Controls project and has also contributed to the OWASP Top 10 Risks project and the OWASP JuiceShop project.\n\n**OWASP Juice Shop**\n*Abstract:*\nOWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security training, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools!\n\nJuice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other security flaws found in real-world applications!\n\nAt this event, we will take a tour through the application, hack it live on screen, learn about Coding Challenges, CTF mode, cheat detection, custom theming, and more!\n\n*Bio:*\nBjoern Kimminich works as Product Group Lead Application Ecosystem at Kuehne + Nagel, responsible \u2013 among other things \u2013 for the Application Security program in corporate IT. He is an OWASP Lifetime Member, the project leader of the OWASP Juice Shop, and a co-chapter leader for the OWASP Germany Chapter. Bj\u00f6rn also currently chairs the OWASP Project Committee."
