        "description": "<p>OWASP Aarhus, Denmark is always greatly honored to welcome both experienced presenters as well as new ones! But they do not get more experienced than these two!</p> <p>In my career path in IT security a handful of people stands out as having had the biggest influence and impact. Two of these are Richard Campbell (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/richjcampbell/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/richjcampbell/</a>) and Paula Januszkiewicz (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulajanuszkiewicz/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulajanuszkiewicz/</a>) and it is therefore a bit of a dream come true that we got them to speak at our meetup \u2013 And at the same meetup!</p> <p>Richard is probably best known from RunAsRadio (<a href=\"https://runasradio.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://runasradio.com</a>) and DotNetRocks (<a href=\"https://www.dotnetrocks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.dotnetrocks.com/</a>) and there have been days in my career where I have found myself talking more back at his podcast then I have talked with my wife that day!</p> <p>Paula is the founder and CEO of CQURE and has been giving presentations on security longer than I can remember. I try to listen/watch as many of them as possible because I always learn something and I am always entertained when she talks! And as she writes on her CV \u201cShe has access to the source code of Windows\u201d</p> <p>Mark this time and come join us!</p> <p>This event is purely virtual but feel free to meetup in groups and it will be updated with more information about the presentations later. It will be held in English</p> <p>The meetup will not be recorded.</p> <p>I will update this page with more information very shortly!</p> "

Then I will cover how guidance based approaches can strengthen the secure life cycle development and promote innovation at faster speed.</p> <p>Speaker:- Trupti Shiralkar , Engineering manager at Datadog, A result oriented, data-driven, hands-on security professional with 13 years of leadership experience. Successfully led \u201cShift-to-left\u201d transformations of security programs to solve challenges in open source software security, application security, cloud security and applied cryptography domains. Strengths include strategic planning, building high performance teams, analyzing security trends, reviewing secure architecture-design, performing code reviews and penetration testing.</p> <p>Talk#2 Threatmodeling web application on premise and on-cloud(AWS)\"</p> <p>I will be covering how to perform threatmodeling on 2 use cases.<br/>1) web application on intranet<br/>2) web application on AWS</p> <p>This would be kind of a live session, we shall draw data flow diagrams for both the use cases during the session.<br/>Once the diagrams are ready, we will find the security issues from the attacker point of view.<br/>There are several methodologies that you can use for threat modeling.<br/>The most popular one is STRIDE. We will be using this methodology on various components in the data flow diagram to derive security issues.<br/>Finally, we will generate a threat report.</p> <p>Speaker:- Satish Govindappa, 15 years of significant expertise in Application Development, \u200bThreat Modeling\u200b, \u200bSecure Design Analysis, Secure Code Review,\u200b Static Code Analysis (SAST), Dynamic Security Analysis (DAST), Penetration testing(PenTest) and Security Automation(DevSecOps).</p> "

Extensive use is made of open source software such as libraries and frameworks. While this is fantastic from a development point of view (allowing for faster development of applications and features), it does present a potential drawback if not done correctly, an increased risk. Often, we see libraries being used and seldom updated, also we see several libraries being blindly with little to not inspections and reviews. This is gold mine for attackers, there are many ways that they have will continue to use this to their advantage. The purpose of this talk is to cover some of the techniques which attackers could use to exploit open source supply chains. This will include a live demonstration of one such technique which an attacker could used. The talk will then focus on the excellent OWASP Dependency Track tool, showing how this can help reduce the risk to organizations when it comes to dealing with open source packages in software.</p> <p>BIO: Sean Wright is the Lead Application Security SME at Immersive Labs with an origin as a software developer. Primarily focused on web-based application security with a special interest in TLS related subjects. Experienced in providing technical leadership in relation to application security, as well as engaging with teams to improve the security of systems that they develop. Passionate to be a part of the community and giving back to the community. Additionally, enjoy spending personal time performing personal security-related research.</p> <p>Meeting info will be visible to you only if you RSVP for the meeting.</p> <p>ATTENTION SPONSORS: YOUR NAME COULD BE HERE<br/>Check out sponsorship opportunities here<br/><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-los-angeles-chapter-meeting-sponsorship-tickets-30572600471\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-los-angeles-chapter-meeting-sponsorship-tickets-30572600471</a></p> "

Writing secure code is even harder. Serious security vulnerabilities often stem from small programming mistakes. As developers, we can safeguard our applications by catching these mistakes in our own code.</p> <p>Performing a source code review is one of the best ways to find security issues in code. But how do you do it? In this workshop, we will first go through the basics of how to review your code for vulnerabilities and some tactics for performing an effective security code review on your application.</p> <p>But the process of manually analyzing code for vulnerabilities can be very time-consuming. In the second part of this talk, we will also talk about how to use the interactive code analysis tool Joern to make code analysis more efficient. How do you effectively trace user input in code? How can you efficiently link bug sources to sensitive sink functions?

Nettacker is able to run various scans using a variety of methods and generate scan reports for applications and networks, including services, bugs, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, default credentials and many other cool features - for example the ability to chain different scan methods. This relatively new (Summer 2017) and a lesser-known OWASP project has generated a huge amount of interest at BlackHat Europe 2018/2019 Arsenal live demo gathering massive crowds of seasoned hackers and penetration testers eager to see this new tool in action. This talk will showcase the OWASP Nettacker project giving an overview of its features and including a live demo of the tool.</p> <p>### Speaker Bio ###<br/>Sam Stepanyan is an OWASP London Chapter Leader and an Independent Application Security Consultant with over 20 years of experience in the IT industry with a background in software engineering and web application development.

If you are launching a microservice into a Kubernetes cluster, or even building an entire AWS virtual infrastructure, IaC can automate the deployment. By building repeatable templates you can also ensure that deployments happen exactly as you design, every time. However, errors in infrastructure configuration are now regarded as the second biggest cause of data breaches. There are many ways to give adversaries an advantage through security misconfigurations. Overly permissive storage volumes, unauthenticated database access, or ports left open to the internet have all been a cause of compromise. The solution? Treat your infrastructure code the same as your application code. During your build process, use tools to scan for infrastructure misconfigurations. When you find them raise alerts or even break the build.</p> <p>In this session, we will discuss common types of IaC misconfigurations, and demonstrate a free, open-source security tool that developers can build into their pipelines to help protect infrastructure from compromise.</p> <p>About Ori Bendet:</p> <p>An experienced product leader combining strong technical and marketing skills, Ori has been leading Checkmarx's flagship product, CxSAST (Static Application Security Testing), a Gartner and Forrester market-leading solution, serving thousands of customers worldwide for the last 2 years.

Security professionals commonly perform it, but anyone can do threat modelling. This hands-on workshop will cover the threat modelling workflow, common classes of vulnerabilities, and hands-on examples that will have *you* discover threats in different systems. Threat Modelling is an integral part of every company\u2019s Security Development Lifecycle. Still, as development teams grow more prominent, security will have to choose which features they want to Threat Model, or they will become a bottleneck for the development organization.</p> <p>Speaker Biography:</p> <p>Jeevan Singh is an Application Security Engineering Manager for Twilio Segment (<a href=\"https://segment.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://segment.com</a>), where he is embedding security into all aspects of the software development process. Jeevan enjoys building a security culture within organizations and educating staff on security best practices. Jeevan is responsible for a wide variety of tasks, including architecting security solutions, working with development teams to resolve security vulnerabilities, and building out security features. Before life in the security space, Jeevan had a wide variety of development and leadership roles over the past 15 years.</p> "
