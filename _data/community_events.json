Several attacks against JWT implementations will be shown.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Adrien de Beaupr\u00e9 realized from an early age that he was better at breaking things than fixing them. When he read The Cuckoo's Egg by Clifford Stoll about the hunt for a computer hacker who broke into a computer at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Adrien realized that he could put his special talents to work in an information security career. Adrien has spent the better part of three decades in the I.T. industry, over 20 of those specializing in information security, making him an experienced penetration tester, team lead, and senior information security professional. During that time, Adrien had the opportunity to be the team of Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games security assessment.</p> "

Part of its success comes from its flexibility and extensibility - which makes the ability to create your own DSL (domain-specific language) not only a possibility but also a common practice. However, with great power comes great responsibility and in the cybersecurity industry, we all know that every feature comes with a new attack surface. In this talk, we're going to explore Ruby's flexibility and power and dive deep into real-world examples of vulnerabilities found in well-known open-source projects as well as vulnerabilities I've found performing code auditing in proprietary source code.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Lucas Amorim is a senior software engineer specialized in distributed systems and application security with over 12 years of experience writing software and performing code-auditing and penetration testing.<br/>He has been involved in many open-source projects, including JRuby, concurrent-ruby, rkt and let's encrypt, he also has several exploits and security advisory published.</p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-amorim-74248313/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-amorim-74248313/</a></p> <p>_____________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p>Intermission: socialization and networking (7:00-7:15)<br/>Hosted by: Farshad and Jeevan</p> <p>_____________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p>Hacking Job Applications (7:15-8:15)<br/>By: Tom Alcock</p> <p>In this portion of the event, Tom is going to talk about how to approach security job applications successfully and landing interviews.

Increasingly complex, exciting and rich, features are standardized by W3C and implemented in web browsers on a normal basis. New browser features introduce interesting privacy challenges for standardization, research and development. I will demonstrate a privacy case study based on the example of Ambient Light Sensor. A web privacy impact assessment of a planned web browser feature, the Ambient Light Sensor API, indicated risks arising from the exposure of overly precise information about the lighting conditions in the user environment. The analysis led to the demonstration of direct risks of leaks of user data, such as the list of visited websites or exfiltration of sensitive content across distinct browser contexts. Our work contributed to the creation of web standards leading to decisions by browser vendors (i.e. obsolescence, non-implementation or modification to the operation of browser features). We highlight the need to consider broad risks when making reviews of new features. I will suggest practically-driven high-level observations lying on the intersection of web security and privacy risk engineering and modeling, and standardization.</p> <p>Dr Lukasz Olejnik acts as an independent security and privacy researcher and advisor. His experience spans research, industry, standardization, and policy. His research interests include information and computer security and privacy, user data disclosure and dissemination problems as well as privacy-sensitive matters related to web browser functionalities, web security, privacy reviews, and privacy impact assessments. His research analysing user tracking and profiling on the web has impacted web standards and web browsers.</p> <p>Lukasz is a World Wide Web Consortium\u2019s (W3C) Invited Expert, where he focuses on privacy of web standards.

Join us for an evening of application security learning and discussions.</p> <p>Visit our OWASP Chapter to learn more about us at <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-chapter-victoria/\" class=\"linkified\">https://owasp.org/www-chapter-victoria/</a></p> <p>Speaker: Amiran Alavidze<br/>Presentation: Securing Managed Kubernetes (1hr)</p> <p>Abstract<br/>It\u2019s clear that Kubernetes has won the container orchestration wars and is here to stay. The complexity, flexibility and rapid development cycle of Kubernetes mean that Kubernetes security landscape varies significantly across deployments and is not well understood generally.</p> <p>This talk focuses on security of managed cloud Kubernetes clusters, which provide a decently secure baseline that addresses the majority of recommendations you\u2019ll find on the Internet. You\u2019ll come out equipped with understanding of the Kubernetes threat model and actionable recommendations for securely running workloads in Kubernetes.</p> <p>Speaker Bio<br/>Amiran is currently Director, Security and Risk Management at Tasktop, building a product security program. With over 15 years in information security in roles ranging from system engineering and security operations to governance, risk and compliance, Amiran is advocating a pragmatic, business-focused approach to security.<br/>Security is not just a job, it\u2019s a passion.</p> <p>Official Event Sponsor: KPMG Canada (<a href=\"https://home.kpmg/ca/en/home.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://home.kpmg/ca/en/home.html</a>)</p> "
