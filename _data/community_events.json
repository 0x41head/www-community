        "description": "OWASP Aarhus and Danske Commodities are happy to invite you to this OWASP Aarhus meetup.\n\n19:00 \u2013 19:05 Welcome by Tobias Evar Lauridsen, Danske Commodities, and Thomas Ljungberg Kristensen, OWASP Aarhus\n\n19:05 \u2013 20:00 Frans aims to facilitate a case study centered around a simulated security breach, where participants will navigate a company through a security incident, emphasizing the management of employees, customers, authorities, and other stakeholders. This exercise will simulate a scenario where the participants must effectively handle the aftermath of a security breach, addressing concerns related to internal personnel, external clients, regulatory bodies, and other relevant stakeholders.\n\nThrough this simulation, Frans aims to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved and enable participants to apply effective strategies in real-world scenarios\n\nAbout Frans: Frans Skovholm is an attorney and partner at DAHL Law Partnership, responsible for DAHL's compliance team, which includes specialists in NIS2, ISMS, and Commercial compliance. Frans specializes in systematic risk management and advisory services related to ISMS management systems, including ISO 27001. He holds certification as an ISO 27001 Lead Implementer from PECB, which he applies in his consultation on information security law. Furthermore, he engages in work related to data protection law, assisting numerous companies in implementing internal regulations to ensure compliance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\n20:00 \u2013 20:30 Networking break\n\n20:30 \u2013 21:25 Overcoming the DevSecOps Imposter Syndrome by Michael Man, DevSecOps Evangelist and Community Leader, Veracode\n\nThe technology landscape is forever changing, and this is also reflective within the security field. As such, it is very overwhelming for people trying to break into the security domain and it is no difference for people who works in it. In this talk, I will share my perspective with how I had tackled this problem, how I drowned in the tsunami of information which impacted me mentally and tips for you to consider taking your first steps with your Continuous Learning journey.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\\- Admit to yourself that nobody knows it all\n\\- Be brave and ask those questions \\(others will be thankful\\)\n\\- Do not let the opinionated people overwhelm you\n\\- Techniques I use as part of my Continuous Learning\n\nAbout Michael: Michael brings more than 20 years of IT security experience. He has advised large enterprises on secure software development, working across all stages of delivery, while engaging with the different stakeholders to deliver successful business outcomes. His favourite certification is his OSCP due to his keen understanding of ethical hacking practices. Michael is also the founder of one of the largest DevSecOps community meetups \u201cDevSecOps - London Gathering\u201d and has co-organised the conference \u201cDevSecOps Days London\u201d.\n\n21:15 \u2013 21:30 Closing notes and goodbyes"

Matthias will present useful insights on his research and privacy implications on several aspects of face recognition. Both talks will be held in English.\n\nDoors are open on 18:00 CEST on and we will begin with the presentations at 18:30 CEST!\n\n**In a nutshell**\nLocation: Strandkai 1, 20457 Hamburg\nStart: February 7th, 6:00 pm CEST\nTitle: *A beginner's guide to SSO (mis)configuration* by Adina Bogert-O'Brien\nTitle: *Omnipresent Biometric Surveillance* by Matthias Marx\nNetworking: Stay there or depending on our mood we'll have an after-talk beer somewhere in the vicinity of the venue\n\n**Abstract: A beginner's guide to SSO (mis)configuration**\nSSO is sold as a way to\n\n* centralize managing your organization\u2019s users,\n* make life easier for your colleagues, and\n* enforce consistent security standards.\n\nBut SSO protocols are just ways for an identity provider to share information about an authenticated identity with another service. Me having a way to tell my vendor \u201cyeah, that\u2019s Bob\u201d doesn\u2019t tell me what the vendor does with this information, or if the vendor always asks me who\u2019s coming in the door.\nA bad SSO implementation can make you think you\u2019re safer, while hiding all the new and fun things that have gone wrong.\nTo get the most out of implementing SSO, I need to know what I\u2019m trying to accomplish and what steps I need to follow to get there. To illustrate why SSO needs to be set up carefully, for each of the things you need to do right, I\u2019ll give you some fun examples of creative ways you and your vendor can do this wrong. We all learn from failure, right???\nI\u2019m sharing this info because this year I got deeply involved in the SSO setup for several vendors at work. It turns out that I\u2019m good at asking weird questions, and it\u2019s an extremely valuable thing to do. If you know how things should be, then you know where they could be broken, and you can ask your vendors (and your colleagues!) \u201cweird questions\u201d before an adversary does.\nI'm especially interested in what the OWASP Hamburg group has to say about these misconfigurations: how does OWASP documentation cover things like this?\n\n**Title: Omnipresent Biometric Surveillance**\nBiometric surveillance is ever-present in Germany and many of us have not realized this. Facial recognition search engines like Clearview AI and Pimeyes feed our faces to their gigantic search indexes without our explicit consent. Matthias shares his experiences attempting to uphold privacy through GDPR, shedding light on the associated challenges.\n\n**Our OWASP \"Stammtisch\"**\nOur meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pen testers and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information.\nFeel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too. Participation is free and open -- as the O in\nOWASP.\n\nCheers, Dirk & Bj\u00f6rn"

Traditional tactics like web application firewalls won\u2019t work for APIs because they have limits to the level of protection they can provide. The challenge of securing APIs is due to two things. First, APIs are built differently making them harder to protect for traditional security solutions looking just at the network layer vs the source code and two teams don\u2019t have the right tools required for full API discovery to truly know what APIs are in use.\n\nJoin Dr. Anirban Banerjee as he discusses:\n\n* Why API security efforts need to incorporate both 3rd party and internal API traffic\n* What\u2019s causing the surge of API-led attacks\n* Why have traditional tools not maintained the sophistication needed to protect APIs in flight\n* Why teams need to locate and catalog every single API for true auditability\n* Q&A"

It presents the three main avenues of attack against Large Language Models (LLMs): direct attacks on the LLMs themselves, compromises in the infrastructure and integrations, and weaknesses in applications. The presentation offers in-depth examples, particularly focusing on \"social engineering\" methods, to illustrate the techniques and consequences of these security breaches.\n\n 19:15 to 19:45 - Top 5 Open Source Tools All Developers Should Know About!\n\nRaz Probstein - Solution Engineer @ Jit\n\nThe Minimum Viable Security (MVS) approach simplifies the integration of security measures into config files, apps, and CI/CD processes using open source tools. This talk focuses on incorporating five key security controls into the CI/CD pipeline, utilizing tools like Bandit, Gitleaks, OSV-Scanner, KICS, and OWASP\u2019s ZAP. These controls, along with custom measures for enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication via Github Security, establish a foundational security framework from the initial code, allowing continuous improvement as applications evolve over time. Code examples and demos will be presented in the session.\n\n 19:45 - 20:15 - Recent Supply Chain Code Attacks\n\nYoad Fekete - Co-Founder & CEO @ Myrror Security\n\nJoin us for a deep-dive into the world of recent software supply chain attacks and how to defend against them.\nIn this lecture, we will discuss the difference between a supply chain attack and a vulnerability, and explore why there has been a significant increase in these types of attacks in the past couple of years.\nWe will showcase various vectors for these attacks with recent attacks examples.\nThe highlight? A technical demo of an attack, similar to the UA-Parser/Ledger Connect kit malicious package attacks.\n\n=====================================================================\n\nThis event is sponsored by Bright Security in collaboration with OWASP Israel.\n\nJoin us at the event physically as we will not include Zoom or remote participation this time."

On the other hand, a non-negligible portion of folks is still puzzled as to what to even do with SBOMs once they have them.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll explore what Dependency-Track is, how it can help organizations in identifying and reducing risk in their software supply chain, and give an outlook into what\u2019s next!\n\n*Bio:*\nAfter years as Security Engineer for a large European payment service provider, Niklas currently works as Cloud Native Engineer for ControlPlane. He is passionate about AppSec, DevSecOps and Open Source. He co-leads the OWASP Dependency-Track project and is a contributor to the OWASP CycloneDX Bill of Materials standard, for which he maintains the official Go tooling.\n\nNote: Stay tuned for the big reveal of another groundbreaking OWASP flagship project"

In this meetup, we will dive into the world of application security, exploring the latest trends, best practices, and techniques to protect web applications from potential threats. Our knowledgeable speakers will cover a wide range of topics including....*\n\nOK - AI generated description is probably not working for our meetups  Let's do it old fashioned way:\n\nHi,\n[OWASP](https://owasp.org/) is a worldwide, non-profit organisation focused on application security issues and we are a Polish chapter of this initiative.\n\nThis time we want to talk about AI and it's influence on our industry and our work. We have invited Karol Przystalski from Codete, who will share his thoughts about security of ML models. Then we will have a discussion about how wide use of generative AI in coding will influence application security.\n\nAgenda:\n\n1. **Machine learning security (Karol Przystalski)**\nMachine learning (ML) and other terms related to it became buzzwords. Many companies would like to introduce machine learning models, even if there are simpler solutions. In the presentation, we show recent security issues related to machine learning models. Next, we do an overview of possible security issues that can happen during building such models. Finally, we demonstrate how to prevent the most popular security problems related to ML on the examples of applications in e-commerce, fintech, and other sectors.\n2. After the break, we will be hosting a **discussion on how AI and Generative AI impact the security of application code**. Are AI-powerd tools a boon or a potential risk? What risks emerge when software engineers start using GenAI? Is the code produced by GenAI more or less secure? Are tools designed for code, such as GitHub Copilot and AWS CodeWhisperer, superior to GPT? Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in the discussion. Share your experiences and thoughts, exchange the latest insights, and learn from each other. Whether you are an experienced software engineer, a newcomer to the world of AI, or simply curious about the influence of Generative AI on code security, your perspective is valuable.\n3. There will be also a room for **short lightning talks** with discussion (typical format is 5-10 minute talk followed by 5-10 minute discussion). [Please submit your ideas](https://forms.gle/7JFiD3z2tKifogvs5) or just show up.\n4. Job announcements. If you are an employer, there will be a chance to present who you are looking for.\n\nPlease RSVP and save the date!\nIf you have a minute, **please share this** with friends and in social media.\n\n**Sponsor wydarzenia**\n[Codete](https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcodete.com%2F&data=05%7C01%7C%7C6abbe7bee00040f7795508db2938e5da%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638149096573255135%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2BYKLHBngHjVS6%2F0INX6RRWCdgE5XHx4jzAxrFguqwrI%3D&reserved=0) is a software company based in Poland that specializes in custom software development and IT consulting.

We will cover the following topics:\n\n* What motivates hackers to target SaaS systems (5%)\n* How hackers conduct reconnaissance on SaaS systems (50%)\n* The anatomy of exploit chains (40%)\n* Strategies for defending against attacks (5%)\n\nOur goal is to provide a practical guide to understanding attackers and defending against them. We will share lots of hacker tips and tricks, and provide plenty of quiz moments to train your intuition. Our focus will be on vulnerabilities that hackers actually care about, rather than theoretical ones. All of our examples will be based on real-world exploit chains, and we will explore multiple vulnerabilities chained together to create media-news-headline-worthy outcomes. By the end of this talk, you will have a better understanding of how attackers think and operate, and you will be better equipped to defend against their attacks.\n\nOur February host and sponsor is Solutional Inc, and the talk will take place in their Portland office at 301 SE 2nd Ave.\n\nPlease RSVP here if you are planning to attend.\n\nThis is a monthly event of OWASP's Portland chapter.\n\n*[This was our January event, which was canceled for weather. We have rescheduled it for February.]*"
