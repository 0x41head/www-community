What continues to surprise him is the misconceptions that surface again and again about which teams should use these technologies and where they can benefit from them. David will debunk some of those myths and give us all a clearer picture on their usefulness and how and where we should be using them.\"\n\n7.00pm - Break\n7.15pm - TALK #2 \"DevSecOps with GitLab: How to embed Security within the Software Delivery Process\" with Stefania Chaplin\n\n\"Implementing DevOps can drastically improve the rate we deliver software. Organisations can go from deploying changes a few times a year to multiple times a day. What about vulnerabilities? Security is often considered an afterthought and this can have dire consequences as the world becomes increasingly reliant on software. How do we embed security into the software delivery process? Security is a quality check, there are multiple types and we need to make the software delivery experience as smooth as possible.In this session, you'll find out more about common pain points, solutions, and how to embed security within the software delivery process and secure your DevOps process.\"\n\n7.45pm - Questions/Any Other Business\n8.00pm - Close\n\n***\n\nNathan + Jim"

Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organisations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.\n\nThe **Cyber Security and Networking** (**CSN**) Research Group at Anglia Ruskin University has close working strategic relationships with industry, professional bodies, law enforcement, government agencies and academia in the delivery of operationally focused applied information and application security research. We have strong international links with professional organisations such as OWASP, BCS, ISC2, IISP & the UK Cyber Security Forum amongst others. The primary aims of CSNRG are to help the UK and partner nations to tackle cybercrime, be more resilient to cyber attacks and educate its users for a more secure cyberspace and operational business environment.\n\n**Abstract : \u201cWhat your Washing Machine says about you: Investigating unusual devices\"**\n\nWith the rise in IoT devices, it is no surprise that such devices are cropping up during criminal, civil, corporate, and intelligence investigations. The media focus users on the security and type of data being transmitted/received by the device. However, the data the device stores are often less secure and provide a wealth of information about your activity.\n\nIn Digital Investigation, typically, we focus on what the device can tell us about the user and system behaviour. In this presentation, Sarah will be discussing the research from her past cases, including investigating a Smart Washing Machine. She will discuss how these cases led to her designing and applying research techniques to extract information from the device to help with the active investigations.\n\nHer casework not only led to actionable intelligence, but the research led to Sarah developing a new framework for acquisition which has been used in a range of casework by various investigation units.\n\n**Provisional Agenda**\n\n16:45 - Webinar waiting lobby opens\n17:00 - Start of Presentation\n17:45 \u2013 Questions & Answers\n18:00 \u2013 Estimated Finish"

There will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event at the venue.\n\n_What's going to happen?\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our OWASP Frankfurt Meetup hosted by **CHECK24 Frankfurt.**\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n* _Talk 1 - \"**AI-Enhanced Application Security: A Modern Approach**\" by **Diana Waithanji**, Cybersecurity engineer at SAP.\nThis talk will discuss how AI is being used to solve application security issues. We will explore the potential benefits of using AI in this area, such as increased efficiency and effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Additionally, we will discuss some of the challenges and limitations that come with using AI in application security and how they can be addressed.\n* _Talk 2 - \"**Beyond the Checkbox: Breaking out of Testing Frameworks**\" by **Jiska Classen**, As mobile applications handle sensitive data, ensuring their security is crucial. However, simply securing individual apps is not enough to stop real-world attackers who exploit devices through other avenues. This talk will explore unconventional security testing approaches that can help improve app security by addressing vulnerabilities in the operating system, hardware, and third-party libraries. Discover how attackers can exploit wireless interfaces, sandboxing, privilege checking bypasses, and more. Let's explore why these attack vectors are relevant in practice and how to address them beyond standard security testing checklists.\n\n_Afterwards? We will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility to **socialize** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **CHECK24 Frankfurt**.\n\n_When\nOur Meetup takes place on the last Wednesday of the month in April, namely on 26.04.2023 from 18:00 to 21.00 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nCHECK24 Frankfurt is located at Speicherstra\u00dfe 55 in Frankfurt am Main, ca. 15min within walking distance of Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nGet in touch with the Frankfurt Chapter Leads (Dan Gora or Jonas Becker)\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"

It isn\u2019t rocket science to know that\u2019s not true. It\u2019s helpful to consider the limitations of tools and processes. This presentation will take attendees through how to define the limitations of threat modeling correctly, understand best practices in how, when, and by whom a proper threat model should be performed, and how this process of identifying threat model limitations can help users better understand its utility to systems and processes.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: [IriusRisk](https://www.iriusrisk.com/)\n*When it comes to application development, security is paramount.

Not only are two major releases in the pipeline (5.0 and 2.0 respectively) but we are now seeing industry stand up, take notice and start expecting more from applications, based on these standards. In this talk, Josh Grossman (one of the ASVS project leaders) will take you through these key developments including our vision for the upcoming version 5.0 of the ASVS and how you and your employer can be involved in the final release.\nThis will also be a chance to hear first-hand about a couple of new programmes where you will see the SVSs being more widely used and required and how you can prepare your organizations for this significant impact this will have, whether you are developing applications or you are assessing them.\n\n*Bio:*\nJosh Grossman has worked as a consultant in IT and Application Security and Risk for 15 years now, as well as a Software Developer. This has given him an in-depth understanding of how to manage the balance between business needs, developer needs and security needs which goes into a successful software security programme.\n\nJosh is currently CTO for Bounce Security where he helps clients improve and get better value from their application security processes and provides specialist application security advice. His consultancy work has led him to work, speak and deliver training both locally and worldwide including privately for ISACA and Manicode and publicly for OWASP's Global AppSec conferences. In his spare time, he co-leads the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard project and is on the OWASP Israel chapter board.\n\nHe was also recognized as a Key Contributor for the OWASP Proactive Controls project and has also contributed to the OWASP Top 10 Risks project and the OWASP JuiceShop project.\n\n**OWASP Juice Shop**\n*Abstract:*\nOWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security training, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools!\n\nJuice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other security flaws found in real-world applications!\n\nAt this event, we will take a tour through the application, hack it live on screen, learn about Coding Challenges, CTF mode, cheat detection, custom theming, and more!\n\n*Bio:*\nBjoern Kimminich works as Product Group Lead Application Ecosystem at Kuehne + Nagel, responsible \u2013 among other things \u2013 for the Application Security program in corporate IT.

He has 20 years of experience in IT and has worked with various startups from stock exchanges to cloud security vendors. Prior to that he worked as an Engineer with and for other Government organizations. Joshua started his career with the United States Marine Corps where he taught marksmanship, martial arts and led cyber teams worldwide for 12 years. He currently teaches as an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at a local college, and volunteers as an OWASP Leader. His interests include reading classics, playing music, playing board games with his family, home automation, losing money with crypto assets, and the outdoors.\n**Title: How to Identify Threat Modeling Limitations**\n**Abstract:**\nMany cyber and application security tools love to say they can do everything needed to protect your assets. It isn\u2019t rocket science to know that\u2019s not true. It\u2019s helpful to consider the limitations of tools and processes. This presentation will take attendees through how to define the limitations of threat modeling correctly, understand best practices in how, when, and by whom a proper threat model should be performed, and how this process of identifying threat model limitations can help users better understand its utility to systems and processes.\n\n**Speaker 2: Jonathan Marcil, NorthSec Challenge Designer**\nJonathan is a board member of the OWASP Orange County chapter. Originally from Montreal, he is part of NorthSec CTF as a challenge designer. He is passionate about Application Security and enjoys architecture analysis, code review, threat modeling and debunking security tools. Jonathan holds a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from ETS Montreal and has more than 19 years of experience in Information Technology and Security.\n**Title: AI (Stable Diffusion) CTF Workshop**\n**Abstract:**\nSurprise! We're going to dive into the marvelous world of \"artificial intelligence\" and \"prompt engineering\".\nThis session will cover two CTF challenges based on Stable Diffusion which is a model capable of generating photo-realistic images given any text input. This will allow us to show in a practical fashion some potential real impact of something otherwise artificial.\nParticipants can bring their laptop to try the challenges by themselves. If you have a gaming laptop with a dedicated graphic card, that could be handy! For the others, rest assured as we will be solving them step by step alongside diving into diffusion models and machine learning technical details.\n\n### **Code of Conduct**\n\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone. Please reach out to one of our chapter leaders if you have any feedback/concerns or would like to speak to us, we take these matters very seriously.

        "description": "Hi all, for our last OWASP Frankfurt Chapter event before the upcoming [German OWASP Day 2023](https://god.owasp.de/2023/) edition, join us for our **Women in AppSec Special**, where we'll be tackling two of the most pressing topics in the industry today: enhancing security culture through security champions, and offensive security beyond the checkbox. There will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event at the venue.\n\n_What's going to happen?\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our OWASP Frankfurt Meetup hosted by **CHECK24 Frankfurt.**\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n* _Talk 1 - \"**AI-Enhanced Application Security: A Modern Approach**\" by **Diana Waithanji**, Cybersecurity engineer at SAP.\nThis talk will discuss how AI is being used to solve application security issues. We will explore the potential benefits of using AI in this area, such as increased efficiency and effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Additionally, we will discuss some of the challenges and limitations that come with using AI in application security and how they can be addressed.\n* _Talk 2 - \"**Beyond the Checkbox: Breaking out of Testing Frameworks**\" by **Jiska Classen**, As mobile applications handle sensitive data, ensuring their security is crucial. However, simply securing individual apps is not enough to stop real-world attackers who exploit devices through other avenues. This talk will explore unconventional security testing approaches that can help improve app security by addressing vulnerabilities in the operating system, hardware, and third-party libraries. Discover how attackers can exploit wireless interfaces, sandboxing, privilege checking bypasses, and more. Let's explore why these attack vectors are relevant in practice and how to address them beyond standard security testing checklists.\n\n_Afterwards? We will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility to **socialize** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **CHECK24 Frankfurt**.\n\n_When\nOur Meetup takes place on the last Wednesday of the month in April, namely on 26.04.2023 from 18:00 to 21.00 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nCHECK24 Frankfurt is located at Speicherstra\u00dfe 55 in Frankfurt am Main, ca. 15min within walking distance of Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nGet in touch with the Frankfurt Chapter Leads (Dan Gora or Jonas Becker)\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"
