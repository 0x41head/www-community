Including security controls in applications sometimes may be considered an overhead. However, if security controls are not added to applications during development, it may be challenging to add them later on. In this presentation, we will see how code can be written insecurely and really how simple it is to include the required security controls in the application.\n\n\"**DevSecOps Worst Practices**\" - Tanya Janca\nQuite often when we read best practices we are told \u2018what\u2019 to do, but not the \u2018why\u2019. When we are told to ensure there are no false positives in the pipeline, the reason seems obvious, but not every part of DevOps is that intuitive, and not all \u2018best practices\u2019 make sense on first blush. Let\u2019s explore tried, tested, and failed methods, and then flip them on their head, so we know not only what to do to avoid them, but also why it is important to do so, with these DevSecOps WORST practices.\n\n**SPEAKERS**\n\n**Shruti Kulkarni ([@shruti-s-kulkarni](https://github.com/Shruti-s-kulkarni))**\nShruti is a cyber security / enterprise security architect with experience in ISO27001, PCI-DSS, policies, standards, security tools, threat modelling, risk assessments. Shruti works on security strategies and collaborates with cross-functional groups to implement information security controls in software development life-cycle, service operations, service delivery such that security controls support business requirements.\n\n**Tanya Janca ([@shehackspurple](https://twitter.com/shehackspurple))**\nTanya Janca, also known as SheHacksPurple, is the best-selling author of \u2018Alice and Bob Learn Application Security\u2019.

Learn From Others in the DevOps and DevSecOps Communities\nLook to the DevOps community to help close your critical knowledge gaps.\n2. 2\\. Start With Your Container Security\nThe first step to building out the security of your DevOps toolchain starts with your container security.\n3. Institute Continuous Compliance\nDevSecOps is a platform for continuous compliance to protect your software supply chains against vulnerable packages and vulnerable configurations.\n4. Double Down on Automation\nWhile you may have already been experimenting with automation during your DevOps phase, it only becomes more integral once you throw the switch in by going DevSecOps. Go into your DevOps to DevSecOps transformation with an automation strategy that focuses on automating common developer and sysadmin tasks.\n5. Improve Your Monitoring and Analytics\nBuilding out a DevSecOps toolchain takes your monitoring and analytics options to a new level. Consider the fact that you should already collect and publish data from your toolchain and deliver reports to your project managers, developers, QA testers, and stakeholders outside your team. Commonly, DevOps reporting is still a work in progress for organizations. Use the introduction of new security tools into your toolchain as a chance to offer more granular and real-time security reporting into all parts of your DevSecOps toolchain.\n6. Implement Accessibility Assurance\nDepending on your organization\u2019s definition of compliance, the option is there to add accessibility compliance or Section 508 to your DevSecOps toolchain.\n\nThis hands-on training is reserver for 70% professional and 30% students.\n\nMandatory:\n\nGeneral Conditions in order to validate your participation to this event:\n\n1\\. Student must send University/Student ID\\, otherwise registration will be rejected\\.\n\n2.Professional must register company emails, otherwise registration will be rejected.\n\nRegistration only via EventBrite.

However, the recent shift in corporate preferences towards MacOS necessitates a reevaluation and development of Red Teaming strategies specific to this. Our presentation delves into the challenges in MacOS during the red teaming excercises (i.e. initial foothold, persistence, lateral movement, etc.).\n\n***Bio:***\n*Ahmed Sherif*: A professional offensive security expert with 7 years of experience in pentesting / red teaming. Ahmed is working at ING global CISO.\n*Ivan Kozlov*: Red teamer at Global CISO of ING who hated macOS so hard that decided to dedicate his spare time in finding vulnerabilities and new red teaming tricks on Apple workstations. Reverse engineered and decrypted state actor malware using MS Paint."

        "description": "*Hacking a SaaS: A Practical Guide to Understanding Attackers and Defending Against Them*\n\nIn this talk, we will delve into the mindset of an attacker and explore the vulnerabilities they exploit in SaaS systems. We will cover the following topics:\n\n* What motivates hackers to target SaaS systems (5%)\n* How hackers conduct reconnaissance on SaaS systems (50%)\n* The anatomy of exploit chains (40%)\n* Strategies for defending against attacks (5%)\n\nOur goal is to provide a practical guide to understanding attackers and defending against them. We will share lots of hacker tips and tricks, and provide plenty of quiz moments to train your intuition. Our focus will be on vulnerabilities that hackers actually care about, rather than theoretical ones. All of our examples will be based on real-world exploit chains, and we will explore multiple vulnerabilities chained together to create media-news-headline-worthy outcomes. By the end of this talk, you will have a better understanding of how attackers think and operate, and you will be better equipped to defend against their attacks.\n\nOur January host and sponsor is Solutional Inc, and the talk will take place in their Portland office at 301 SE 2nd Ave.\n\nPlease RSVP here if you are planning to attend.\n\nThis is a monthly event of OWASP's Portland chapter."

Rapid evolvement of tools, methods, and novel approaches is prompting businesses to swiftly adopt fresh solutions to harness the potential of this emerging paradigm. However, as new technologies, methodologies, and work practices are introduced, hackers also adapt and innovate, always staying one step ahead.\nThis session led by cybersecurity specialist Krister Hedfors will explore the techniques that hackers use to leverage, manipulate, and exploit GenAI systems, such as ChatGPT and Code Llama. He will also give an introduction to OWASP top 10 list for Large Language Models (LLM).\n\nThe meeting will start with a mingle at 18:00, the main presentation beginning (with online attendees) at 18:30"
