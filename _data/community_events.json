We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.\" The Internet of today is an amazing place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr. Barlow's original vision.\n\nIn the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis, state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars. We must be free to communicate and associate without fear. To realize our right to privacy and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions. CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to privacy and anonymity online. Topics include technologies like TOR, full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more. CryptoParties are free to attend, public, and not commercially aligned.\n\nAt our January 31, 2023 OWASP Austin meeting, we will host a CryptoParty with the goal of inviting others to join us in learning about the tools and technologies that enable an individual's right to privacy. When the time comes, we will encourage you all to invite your family, friends, and peers to attend this event, but for now, I am looking for others who are willing to give a 10 minute max presentation on a crypto-oriented subject. The presentation will need to be laid out so that novice and experienced alike can take action based on the data presented. All tools must be free and open source. If you are interested in presenting, please e-mail me directly (do not reply to the list) with your name, bio, talk title, and abstract for consideration. This is going to be EPIC!"

This is a joint meetup with Pacific Hackers group(www.phack.org).\n\nCourtesy of our host **[Tromzo](https://tromzo.com/)** . Tromzo accelerates remediation of risks, from code to cloud. Built by security practitioners & backed by 25+ CISOs.\n\n**Talk#1:** Frictionless API Observability.Visibility of API assets, and their underlying JSON structure is a critical requirement for any security initiative that manages attack surfaces.This live session will demonstrate how Microservices in a Kubernetes environment can be instrumented by a no-code/agentless sensor to auto-discover, and auto-generate OpenAPI docs for all APIs present.\n\nSpeaker: Harish Natraj, co-founder of Levo.ai. He has deep experience in the APIs, microservices, and Kubernetes space. He has spent the last 10 years building and operating API Observability and Security solutions. He is passionate about empowering modern development teams to build secure and robust applications.\n\n**Talk#2:** Shadow Access has emerged as the most potent attack vector in the Cloud that creates exploitable pathways to an organization's crown jewels. Adversaries are shifting their attention to attacking DATA, Applications and software supply chains by weaponizing exploitable access pathways.\n\nWhat is Shadow Access?\nThe widespread use of cloud services and the increase in data-centric applications has led to the proliferation of data stores containing sensitive information. There is a high demand for access to this large volume of data, but it has also created a new problem called Shadow Access, which refers to unauthorized, unregulated, and invisible access to cloud data, applications, and software. In simple terms, shadow access must not exist and should be removed.\nWhat creates Shadow Access? Cloud identities, roles, permissions, policies, entitlements and vulnerabilities combine to create exploitable access pathways to DATA and applications. SEC-2 and SEC-5 of the OWASP Top 10 Security Risks are examples of Shadow Access impacting CI CD systems.\nThis talk will describe the problem of Shadow Access using the AWS Cloud as an exemplar. It will differentiate between status quo and the state of the art in detection engineering for Shadow Access. The talk will cover more 20+ detections of Shadow Access describing various techniques to detect and remove shadow access and its impact on audit, compliance and governance.\n\nSpeaker Bio\nVenkat Raghavan is the founder and CEO at Stack Identity. He is an operator, builder, and entrepreneur with over 25 years of enterprise software experience spanning big tech and start-ups. Venkat has held a variety of senior operational roles in products, research and development and general management. His areas of expertise include incubating, developing, and scaling businesses in Cyber Security, Cloud Native technologies and AI/ML."

Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.\n\nThe **Cyber Security and Networking** (**CSN**) Research Group at Anglia Ruskin University has close working strategic relationships with industry, professional bodies, law enforcement, government agencies and academia in the delivery of operationally focused applied information and application security research. We have strong international links with professional organisations such as OWASP, BCS, ISC2, IISP & the UK Cyber Security Forum amongst others. The primary aims of CSNRG are to help the UK and partner nations to tackle cybercrime, be more resilient to cyber attacks and educate its users for a more secure cyberspace and operational business environment. These will be achieved through the investigation of threats posed to information systems and understanding the impact of attacks and creation of cyber-based warning systems which gathering threat intelligence, automate threat detection, alert users and neutralising attacks. For network security we are researching securing the next generation of software defined infrastructures from the application API and control/data plane attacks. Other key work includes Computer forensic analysis, digital evidence crime scenes and evidence visualisation as well as Cyber educational approaches such as developing Capture the Flag (CTF) resources and application security programs.\n\n**Abstract : \u201cAutomation of digital crime investigation using Reinforcement Learning (RL)\u201d**\n\nCurrent human-led Digital Investigation is reaching its limit, notably with the explosive increase in cybercrime. DFIR practitioners at law enforcement and corporate levels are facing severe challenges in coping with the demand. This talk will discuss the possible use of new Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches to automate and optimise some of the processes in DFIR practice and thus off-load experts and increase efficiency.\n\n**Provisional Agenda**\n\n16:45 - Webinar waiting lobby opens\n17:00 - Start of Presentation\n17:50 \u2013 Questions & Answers"

They identify three core challenges:\n\n1\\. the sheer volume of data and devices leading to backlogs and delays in investigations\\.\n\n2\\. the complexity of digital examinations including the variety of devices available\\, use of encryption\\, the number of data formats used\\, and the increasing use of cloud storage;\n\nand\n\n3\\. the need to maintain the legitimacy of the police in the digital landscape given 1 and 2 and law enforcement\u2019s need to work in new ways to deal with these issues\\. \\(ibid\\.\\)\n\nGiven the volume of data and complexity of the examinations digital forensic (DF) practitioners work with regularly, this research interviewed 12 DF practitioners in an attempt to understand how the user interface of DF tools may exacerbate these issues, and what their suggestions may be to mitigate these. This work explores the responses, provides and initial analysis, and provides suggestions for how these findings may feed into the next generation of DF tools.\n\nNPCC (2020) Digital Forensic Science Strategy (PDF) (Accessed: 06 October 2022).\n\n**Provisional Agenda**\n\n16:45 - Webinar waiting lobby opens\n17:00 - Start of Presentation\n17:50 \u2013 Questions & Answers\n18:00 \u2013 Estimated Finish"

Groups as diverse as teenage hackers to North Korean spies have devised schemes to circumvent these improvements. Direct attacks on the MFA tools themselves have also allowed APTs unfettered access to enterprises. A strong understanding of recent successful Identity Based Attacks can guide us to stronger solutions. We will look at attacks from social engineering to hidden back doors, showing attacker trends, solution weaknesses and stronger solutions will be highlighted.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: **Ermetic**\nErmetic helps prevent breaches by reducing the attack surface of cloud infrastructure and enforcing least privilege at scale in the most complex environments.

In this talk, we will focus on techniques we can use to build defense-in-depth software. What can we do to proactively architect software to be more resilient to attacks? What type of findings may not be discovered via automated static analysis? How can we design our software to be more friendly during incident response scenarios? Throughout this talk, we will focus on identifying often-overlooked architectural anti-patterns and vulnerabilities to be on the lookout for. We will source code to analyze patterns for improvement in both real-world applications as well as intentionally vulnerable applications. Engineers will leave this talk with a solid understanding of defense-in-depth software architecture and design. Security engineers or consultants can expect to leave with an increased understanding of insecure design patterns and vulnerabilities."

With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scale. Establishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, lightweight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n### **Code of Conduct**\n\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone. Please reach out to one of our chapter leaders if you have any feedback/concerns or would like to speak to us, we take these matters very seriously.

To meet these requirements, organizations need to adopt capabilities whether practices (e.g., threat modelling, vulnerability scanning, etc.) or tools (e.g., SAST, SCA, DAST, CSPM, etc.). The value of hiring specialists and buying tools will not be realized unless the associated services, processes, procedures are adopted.This talk will focus on presenting an approach to building capabilities and highlight underlying principles behind adoption. This framework covers both the general components of a capability and the components required to adopt a capability. We\u2019ll present a framework that incorporates relevant third-party research from fields outside of security and applies them to the security domain to help explain why some are successful in implementing and adopting capabilities while others are not.\n\nThis talk is for anyone involved in designing, building, and managing application security and product security programs. Takeaways:\n\n* Universal framework on capability development that prompts us to think about what we will need to ensure success and adoption.\n* Understanding of the principles behind adoption.\n* Perspective of how team topologies (structure and interactions) influences our ability to achieve desired results.\n* An approach to measuring progress.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nJon Shapransky is a Technical Principal Security Consultant at Kroll with over 10 years of experience in Information Security. Since beginning his career, Jon has performed various forms of security assessments and helped clients build security programs and capabilities. Jon has worked with a wide range of client from both the public and private sector. His experience includes working with Fortune 100, Fortune 500, and Fortune Global 500 orgnisations across various industries and work with all levels of government, health care, and higher education. Presently, Jon is focussed on helping clients build Application Security and DevSecOps programs where he designs, architects, and helps implement related capabilities and processes."

This time, Marcin Szyd\u0142owski will share his thoughts about the future of application security and Daniel Krasnokucki, current OWASP Poland Chapter Leader will speak about microservices security.\nAs usual, we are open to discuss any application security related topic, there will be a time for open discussion or to present IT security related jobs if you are an employer.\n\nPlease RSVP and save the date!\nIf you have a minute, please share this link with friends and in social media.\nBTW - if you have interesting topic to talk about, [send us your proposal](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUbie8Veh30EcRWhyq8ZFUUjz9d2sMqJx_DkIfrnMhO15LTA/viewform).\n\n**Agenda:**\n\n* AppSec trends & predictions 2023 (Marcin Szyd\u0142owski)\n* Microservices development vs OWASP Top10 A1 (Daniel Krasnokucki)\n* Open discussion / Lightning talks / IT Security jobs (if any)\n\n**AppSec trends & predictions 2023**\nIt is this time of the year when cybersecurity professionals pull out their crystall balls and tarot cards to predict what will be the industry trends in the next 12 months. Over the last few weeks I had a chance to plan what to focus on in 2023 and clash my opinions with some of the AppSec/ProductSec leaders in Poland. As interviewed individuals represent many different points of view (security consultants, bug bounty hunters, product security leaders) we have an interesting mixture of opinions and thoughts on SSDLC and Product Security in general.\nIf you are interested in most problematic vulnerabilities, upcoming challenges for software houses or predicted changes in tools & methodologies join us in Krakow and be part of the discussion.\"\n*Speaker's bio:*\n**Marcin Szyd\u0142owski** \\- Cybersecurity professional who spent last 10 years on improving security posture of different\\-sized companies in various industries\\. Started his security journey as a pentester and security consultant\\, went through building global teams responsible for application security in international companies and currently acts as a head of security at Booksy\\. Continuously struggling to find free time to do bug bounty hunting\\.\n\n**Microservices development vs OWASP Top10 A1.** Authorization in multilayer architecture\n\nNowadays all companies try to make software in agile way. The smaller pieces are done, the better. Architecture of computer programs changed a lot and everyone is try going into microservices, microfrontends and a lot of communication between those. BUT... wait... which layer is responsible for authorization? In the short presentation I will present main challenges and possible solutions in microservices world and hopefully open some discussion about your experience in this area!\n\n*Speaker's bio:*\n**Daniel Krasnokucki** \\- developer and appsec guy\\, who leads Product Security team @ Equinix\\. Every day works on improving\\, testing and automating security for very dynamic and innovative software\\. After work \\(as much as possible\\) training people about development and security and if any free time is left \\- spending time with family\\, dog and trying to find time for sport\\.\\.\\.\n\n**Open discussion / Lightning Talks / IT Security jobs**\nThe stage is yours. If you have something inspiring to share or just IT security related job offer - don't hesitate, it's open meeting and it's all about exchange of views and information."

You wear many hats, juggle many tasks, and put out many fires - and that is to get your product off the ground. I have worked with heaps of companies that fit that description, and when you mention the words 'security' you can often feel the energy get sucked out of the room. It is a pretty daunting subject, especially with the current state and popularity of cyber security in the news.\n\nJoin us while we discuss how to scope the size of your security needs and share practical, low-cost steps you can take towards security - depending on how big your startup is. If you have had any victories (or lessons learned the hard way) when setting good security foundations for your startup, bring them along too!\n\n**Erica Anderson (@sputina)**\nErica (she/her) is just a huge ol' nerd. She has been a security consultant, security platform engineer, incident responder, security analyst, and instructor. Right now she spends most of her time as the COO and Co-Founder of SafeStack where they are all about secure development training and community building."
