We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.\" The Internet of today is an amazing place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr. Barlow's original vision.\n\nIn the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis, state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars. We must be free to communicate and associate without fear. To realize our right to privacy and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions. CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to privacy and anonymity online. Topics include technologies like TOR, full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more. CryptoParties are free to attend, public, and not commercially aligned.\n\nAt our January 31, 2023 OWASP Austin meeting, we will host a CryptoParty with the goal of inviting others to join us in learning about the tools and technologies that enable an individual's right to privacy. When the time comes, we will encourage you all to invite your family, friends, and peers to attend this event, but for now, I am looking for others who are willing to give a 10 minute max presentation on a crypto-oriented subject. The presentation will need to be laid out so that novice and experienced alike can take action based on the data presented. All tools must be free and open source. If you are interested in presenting, please e-mail me directly (do not reply to the list) with your name, bio, talk title, and abstract for consideration. This is going to be EPIC!"

Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.\n\nThe **Cyber Security and Networking** (**CSN**) Research Group at Anglia Ruskin University has close working strategic relationships with industry, professional bodies, law enforcement, government agencies and academia in the delivery of operationally focused applied information and application security research. We have strong international links with professional organisations such as OWASP, BCS, ISC2, IISP & the UK Cyber Security Forum amongst others. The primary aims of CSNRG are to help the UK and partner nations to tackle cybercrime, be more resilient to cyber attacks and educate its users for a more secure cyberspace and operational business environment. These will be achieved through the investigation of threats posed to information systems and understanding the impact of attacks and creation of cyber-based warning systems which gathering threat intelligence, automate threat detection, alert users and neutralising attacks. For network security we are researching securing the next generation of software defined infrastructures from the application API and control/data plane attacks. Other key work includes Computer forensic analysis, digital evidence crime scenes and evidence visualisation as well as Cyber educational approaches such as developing Capture the Flag (CTF) resources and application security programs.\n\n**Abstract : \u201cAutomation of digital crime investigation using Reinforcement Learning (RL)\u201d**\n\nCurrent human-led Digital Investigation is reaching its limit, notably with the explosive increase in cybercrime. DFIR practitioners at law enforcement and corporate levels are facing severe challenges in coping with the demand. This talk will discuss the possible use of new Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches to automate and optimise some of the processes in DFIR practice and thus off-load experts and increase efficiency.\n\n**Provisional Agenda**\n\n16:45 - Webinar waiting lobby opens\n17:00 - Start of Presentation\n17:50 \u2013 Questions & Answers"

An interactive visualization of this taxonomy, available as open source itself, will be demoed throughout the talk to explain different techniques at the disposal of attackers, supported by real-world examples.\nFollowing, we will discuss the types of defenses you can put in place to detect and respond to such modern day attacks.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: Endor Labs\nEndor Labs\u2019 Dependency Lifecycle Management Platform is designed to address the weakest link in software supply chain security: the ungoverned sprawl of open source software in the enterprise. Endor Labs\u2019 mission is to help developers spend less time dealing with security issues and more time accelerating development through safe code reuse. With this solution, development and security teams are able to maximize software reuse by safely evaluating, maintaining, and updating dependencies at scale.\n\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*"

Groups as diverse as teenage hackers to North Korean spies have devised schemes to circumvent these improvements. Direct attacks on the MFA tools themselves have also allowed APTs unfettered access to enterprises. A strong understanding of recent successful Identity Based Attacks can guide us to stronger solutions. We will look at attacks from social engineering to hidden back doors, showing attacker trends, solution weaknesses and stronger solutions will be highlighted.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: **Ermetic**\nErmetic helps prevent breaches by reducing the attack surface of cloud infrastructure and enforcing least privilege at scale in the most complex environments.

With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scale. Establishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, lightweight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n### **Code of Conduct**\n\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

To meet these requirements, organizations need to adopt capabilities whether practices (e.g., threat modelling, vulnerability scanning, etc.) or tools (e.g., SAST, SCA, DAST, CSPM, etc.). The value of hiring specialists and buying tools will not be realized unless the associated services, processes, procedures are adopted.This talk will focus on presenting an approach to building capabilities and highlight underlying principles behind adoption. This framework covers both the general components of a capability and the components required to adopt a capability. We\u2019ll present a framework that incorporates relevant third-party research from fields outside of security and applies them to the security domain to help explain why some are successful in implementing and adopting capabilities while others are not.\n\nThis talk is for anyone involved in designing, building, and managing application security and product security programs. Takeaways:\n\n* Universal framework on capability development that prompts us to think about what we will need to ensure success and adoption.\n* Understanding of the principles behind adoption.\n* Perspective of how team topologies (structure and interactions) influences our ability to achieve desired results.\n* An approach to measuring progress.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nJon Shapransky is a Technical Principal Security Consultant at Kroll with over 10 years of experience in Information Security. Since beginning his career, Jon has performed various forms of security assessments and helped clients build security programs and capabilities. Jon has worked with a wide range of client from both the public and private sector. His experience includes working with Fortune 100, Fortune 500, and Fortune Global 500 orgnisations across various industries and work with all levels of government, health care, and higher education. Presently, Jon is focussed on helping clients build Application Security and DevSecOps programs where he designs, architects, and helps implement related capabilities and processes."
