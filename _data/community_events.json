It's like a code-aware grep, enabling you to easily search for complicated code patterns without writing painful abstract syntax tree (AST) visitors or using heavyweight, expensive, proprietary traditional SAST tools.</p> <p>Key Semgrep features:<br/>- Fast - scans code in minutes, not hours or days.<br/>- Does not require the source code you\u2019re scanning to be buildable.<br/>- Comes out of the box with over 1,000 open source rules covering the OWASP Top 10 and more.<br/>- Supports languages including Python, Java, Golang, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and more on the way.<br/>- Autofix - Don't just point out bugs, help developers fix them!<br/>- Most importantly, Semgrep makes it easy to write custom rules, no fancy DSL required. This empowers AppSec engineers and developers to detect and block company-specific security bugs and anti-patterns as well as enforce best practices.</p> <p>We\u2019ll demo how to easily write custom Semgrep rules tailored to your specific code base, and how to get continuous security coverage in CI in a just a few minutes.</p> <p>Bio: Clint Gibler (@clintgibler) is the Head of Security Research for r2c, a startup working on giving security tools directly to developers.

With the current security initiated shift-left paradigm, what is changed in and around software development with the regards of [application] security responsibilities?</p> <p>Long:</p> <p>With the business increased the pressure and demand for flexibility of the development team, the agile movement was pushed to the limits. CI/CD was born to reduce manual steps to reduce human errors and increase speed to go-live! Last not least, with DevOps the teams took application responsibilities, from cradle to grave. Nevertheless, software security is still missing in many full-stack developers' resumes and application security responsibilities are pushed off to the security department still. Petty, because the exactly agile, CI/CD and DevOps are security enabling practices.</p> <p>This session is explaining Shift-left, early security enablement in the development Lifecycle. As the application development becomes more developer centric, the developer\u2019s toolset must match the new challenges to have responsibilities matching capabilities. Learn from rugged software to supply chain cleanliness. Learn to avoid the common pitfalls and benefits of modern application development strategies. Hear why security champions programmes tend to fail, compliance driven security training is a waste of time and money. Security teams struggle and fail to integrate security tooling in release pipelines.<br/>Take back the best practices, proven solutions and Shift Left beyond the development.</p> <p>Speaker :</p> <p>Martin Knobloch, Global AppSec Strategist at Micro Focus, is a long-time information security leader with more than 15 years of experience in the field.

        "description": "<p>Today\u2019s software-driven world is built on APIs, which are increasingly becoming the heartbeat of every modern mobile, B2B, IoT, and web application. APIs enable developers to write data-driven and flexible applications that all end-users and organizations require and desire. However, while APIs have clear and obvious benefits, they also create a rapidly-growing attack surface that isn\u2019t widely understood and sometimes completely overlooked by developers. Recent reports suggest that by 2022, API abuses will be the most responsible vector for data breaches within enterprise web applications. Therefore, securing them is a top challenge and must be a top priority. In this talk, we will highlight the security risks presented by the naive use of APIs and why an increased level of awareness is required to mitigate the risks. Next, we will dive into the top 10 API security risks presented in the OWASP API Top 10 list. From API-specific issues like broken object-level authorization and excessive data exposure to more familiar issues like injection risks. The list rounds up the most critical API threats while also providing explanations and example attack scenarios</p> <p>Speaker: Erez Yalon<br/>Erez Yalon, Head of Security Research, oversees Checkmarx\u2019s research team comprising analysts, pen-testers, secure developers, and bug bounty hunters.

        "description": "<p>Today\u2019s software-driven world is built on APIs, which are increasingly becoming the heartbeat of every modern mobile, B2B, IoT, and web application. APIs enable developers to write data-driven and flexible applications that all end-users and organizations require and desire. However, while APIs have clear and obvious benefits, they also create a rapidly-growing attack surface that isn\u2019t widely understood and sometimes completely overlooked by developers. Recent reports suggest that by 2022, API abuses will be the most responsible vector for data breaches within enterprise web applications. Therefore, securing them is a top challenge and must be a top priority. In this talk, we will highlight the security risks presented by the naive use of APIs and why an increased level of awareness is required to mitigate the risks. Next, we will dive into the top 10 API security risks presented in the OWASP API Top 10 list. From API-specific issues like broken object-level authorization and excessive data exposure to more familiar issues like injection risks. The list rounds up the most critical API threats while also providing explanations and example attack scenarios</p> <p>Speaker: Erez Yalon<br/>Erez Yalon, Head of Security Research, oversees Checkmarx\u2019s research team comprising analysts, pen-testers, secure developers, and bug bounty hunters. He brings vast experience to his position, and his efforts empower today\u2019s developers and organizations to deliver more secure software, applications, and devices. Erez is the co-founder of the DEF CON AppSec Village and co-led the development of the OWASP API Security Top 10 list. Over the years, Erez has been invited to speak at prominent events, including RSA Conference, Infosecurity Europe, Black Hat, and DEF CON, while also being featured in news outlets such as Fortune, Forbes, WIRED, TechCrunch, and Dark Reading.</p> <p>Twitter: @ErezYalon<br/>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/erezyalon/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/erezyalon/</a></p> "

Responsible<br/>disclosure by whitehat hackers is the last bastion of defense against<br/>these hacks. We will review several several smart contracts that were<br/>the subject of responsible disclosures. After a conversation with the<br/>audience about the vulnerability, we will examine the technical<br/>details of the bug. We will consider the root causes of the<br/>vulnerability and discuss practices the project could have adopted in<br/>order to avoid this class of bugs in the future.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Duncan Townsend, CTO<br/>With a background as a Machine Learning and Security Engineer. After<br/>completing a S.B. and M.Eng. in AI at MIT, he has worked at a series<br/>of pure-tech startups before co-founding his own at Immunefi. While at<br/>MIT, in 2010, he started hacking on cryptocurrency projects. Other<br/>past projects have included direct image-to-trajectory deep neural<br/>nets, zero-knowledge homomorphic encryption chat routing, formally<br/>verified encrypted chat, and a high-performance regular expression<br/>compiler. At Immunefi, he is tapping into his expertise not only in<br/>software security best practices, but also in physical security,<br/>operational security, and encryption.</p> <p>---------------------</p> <p>Title: Web application security using HAProxy</p> <p>Summary:<br/>HAProxy load balancer: implementacija vi\u0161erazinskog filtriranja i za\u0161tite za Web aplikacije</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Ja sam Dinko Koruni\u0107, i trenutno sam product manager u Crossvallii i senior sistemski in\u017eenjer u HAProxy Technologies. Ina\u010de sam radoholi\u010dar, a ne\u0161to malo slobodnog vremena \u0161to ostane nakon obiteljskih obaveza se bavim \u010ditanjem, u\u010denjem novih tehnologija i sistemskim programiranjem. Bio sam konzultant za sigurnost i sistemac za InfoMAR, SRCE i CARNet, neko vrijeme sam pisao i Linux \u010dlanke za Mrezu, a u proteklih 25 godina radio sam razli\u010dite uglavnom Unix-oriented poslove \u0161to kod nas (na vecini tehni\u010dkih fakulteta u Zagrebu, uredu Predsjednika HR, Ministarstvu financija, RecroNet, Tmobile itd.) kao i vani. Trenutni fokus su mi velika skladi\u0161ta podataka (300+PB) i HAProxy kao load-balancer za enterprise upotrebe te integracije HAProxyja sa cloud providerima poput Amazona, Azurea kao integracija sa Dockerom, Kubernetesom itd.</p> "

It's like a code-aware grep, enabling you to easily search for complicated code patterns without writing painful abstract syntax tree (AST) visitors or using heavyweight, expensive, proprietary traditional SAST tools.</p> <p>Key Semgrep features:<br/>- Fast - scans code in minutes, not hours or days.<br/>- Does not require the source code you\u2019re scanning to be buildable.<br/>- Comes out of the box with over 1,000 open source rules covering the OWASP Top 10 and more.<br/>- Supports languages including Python, Java, Golang, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and more on the way.<br/>- Autofix - Don't just point out bugs, help developers fix them!<br/>- Most importantly, Semgrep makes it easy to write custom rules, no fancy DSL required. This empowers AppSec engineers and developers to detect and block company-specific security bugs and anti-patterns as well as enforce best practices.</p> <p>We\u2019ll demo how to easily write custom Semgrep rules tailored to your specific code base, and how to get continuous security coverage in CI in a just a few minutes.</p> <p>Bio: Clint Gibler (@clintgibler) is the Head of Security Research for r2c, a startup working on giving security tools directly to developers. Previously, Clint was a Research Director at NCC Group, a global security consulting firm, where he helped companies implement security automation and DevSecOps best practices as well as performed penetration tests for companies ranging from large enterprises to new startups. Clint has previously spoken at conferences including BlackHat USA, AppSec USA/EU/Cali, BSidesSF, and many DevSecCons. Clint holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Davis.

Threat modeling is considered to be a key activity, but can be challenging to perform for developers, and even more so in agile software development. Hence, threat modeling has not seen widespread use in agile software projects. The goal of the presentation is to show some of these challenges and approaches that the teams are working on.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Dr. Monica Iovan, Head of Security Development, Visma; In her free time, Monica enjoys peaceful moments in nature and the company of a good book. She is a passionate researcher having the goal of simplifying the use of security services within Agile development. She leads the security development team in Visma and conducts research on security in agile software development.</p> <p>Dr. Daniela S. Cruzes is a Professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Previously, she worked as a senior research scientist at SINTEF in Norway. She has also been a researcher fellow at the University of Maryland and Fraunhofer Center for Experimental Software Engineering-Maryland. Dr. Daniela Cruzes received her PhD in experimental software engineering from the University of Campinas - UNICAMP in Brazil in 2007. Her research interests are empirical software engineering, research methods and theory development, synthesis of SE studies, software security, software testing and agile and DevOps.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;Abstract - Security through an iterative process<br/>Security through an iterative process is a collection of notes collected in 15+ years\u2019 experience. We will go through what has worked for most companies, some myths and some of the common things that are typically missing, but that everybody wants.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Dario Cavallaro has been working in IT Security for over 15 years. Passionate about Linux, Opensource and Security, he has been working in both defensive and offensive security industry. Dario has a Bachelor degree in Computer science, where he focused on Software development and Software engineering. Before that, he collaborated with several opensource projects, like Gentoo.</p> "
