Here's what Jeff will be covering:\n\nAfter over 20 years, achieving app and API security still requires Herculean effort by smart and dedicated people. Fortunately, we can look to history and see a path forward. In the mid-2000s we changed the curve on kernel exploits by adding ASLR and DEP to operating systems. Imagine hardening your web app and web API stacks against all the major classes of vulnerability. You could instantly notify developers if they introduce a vulnerability and you could stop vulnerable software from being exploited. How would it change your appsec program if you could dramatically reduce the risk of all the common classes of vulnerability? In this talk, we\u2019ll explain how runtime protection works and how you can streamline vulnerability management and ensure your software doesn\u2019t get exploited\u2026 at the same time."

Allerdings sind sie auch bekannt f\u00fcr ihre subtil schwierige Anwendung und die damit verbundenen Sicherheitsl\u00fccken.\n\nRust tritt hier als vielversprechende Alternative auf: Es bietet die gleichen Vorteile in Bezug auf Leistung und Kontrolle, bringt jedoch auch Speichersicherheit und Threadsicherheit mit. Zudem l\u00f6st es weitere gesamte Klassen an Fehlern wie z.B. NULL-Pointer-Dereferenzierung auf.\n\nRust ist bereits jetzt fester Bestandteil des Linux- und Windows-Kernels und wird f\u00fcr neue Komponenten in Android eingesetzt.\n\nDie Kombination aus Leistung, Sicherheit und nicht zuletzt einer tollen Community mit hohen sozialen Standards macht Rust zur Sprache der Wahl f\u00fcr moderne Programmierung.\n\nDer Vortrag gibt einen kurzen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die Programmiersprache Rust und soll zum Auszuprobieren anregen. Dazu gibt es einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Live-Coding Anteil um zu zeigen wie die Arbeit mit Rust aussieht und welche Konzepte die Sprache so besonders machen.\n\n**Generelles zum OWASP-Stammtisch**\n===\n\nBei unseren offenen Treffen geht es um Software und deren Sicherheit im Internet und/oder IT-Security allgemein. Es treffen sich Leute, die sich beruflich oder privat damit auseinandersetzen: Entwickler, Manager, \"Pentester\" und alle an (Web)sicherheit interessierte. Die Atmosph\u00e4re ist offen und locker. Uns geht's um den Erfahrungsaustausch, Technikschnack und ums Netzwerken. Wer Produkte oder Dienstleistungen verkaufen will, ist hier falsch. Ihr seid herzlich willkommen Kollegen oder Bekannte den Hinweis auf unser Treffen weiterzuleiten. Alle Treffen sind frei, f\u00fcr jeden offen und kostenlos.\n\nSch\u00f6nen Gru\u00df, Bj\u00f6rn / Dirk"

How to Deploy it\nJoin us for great networking, dinner and drinks, and see a presentation by President and Founder of iSecurePrivacy, LLC.\n\n**ABSTRACT**: Security Architecture is a security design that addresses the technology goals, approaches, controls, and potential for the enterprise. It also specifies when and where to apply security controls. This discussion starts from the enterprise perspective using SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture). It then introduces COBIT, from ISACA, which is a framework that focuses on the governance and management of enterprise IT. TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) aligns security with business needs. Then there is the OWASP SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model) that is a framework for helping organizations analyze their current software security practices in the development of new applications. Within these four security architectures, we will also talk about some software secure coding standards such as (PCI Software Security Framework, SEI CERT Coding Standards, NIST SSDF, Microsoft Secure Coding Guidelines , and OWASP Secure Coding Practices). These standards are important, but they need to be based on meeting the business strategic objectives, business model, and business needs. That is what security architectures provide.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: *[Prisma Cloud](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud)*\n*The Most Complete Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP). Prisma Cloud secures applications from code to cloud, enabling security and DevOps teams to effectively collaborate to accelerate secure cloud-native application development and deployment.*\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available**\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

Brought to you in collaboration with Dr. Pedram from SecDim, this time a King of the Hill style challenge. Build your app, attack other's apps, and iterate on improving your defences.\n\nHow will this work?\n\nThis is a battle challenge. You have limited time to address the security vulnerabilities in your code. Once you push your code, you enter the battle page where you can hack other players app. Anytime you successfully hack a player's app, you need to extract the flag. You then submit the flag to get the score. The earlier you defend your app or hack another player's, the higher will be your ranking.\n\nNOTE: If a player hacks your app, you will lose the score and get kicked out of the battle page. You may try again.\n\nNo presentation, no lecture. This is a hands-on session to up-skill in secure programming. Please bring your laptop with your development environment set up and ready to go, so that you can jump right into the action.\n\n**We will explore these weaknesses**:\n\n* CWE-35 and CWE-23\n\n**Agenda**:\n\n* 6:00-6:10 Welcome\n* 6:10-7:30 Let the battle begin.\n\nThis event is not catered, but you're welcomed to bring your own food along.\n\n**Prepare**:\nIf you are a first timer, **get your workstation setup** by completing any of the \"Start Here\" levels on [https://play.secdim.com](https://play.secdim.com/) (SecDim Play is a training game for secure programming)\n\n**Contribute**: Help to foster the community by **contributing a secure programming challenge**. Follow the guide at [https://github.com/secdim/play-sdk](https://github.com/secdim/play-sdk).\n\n**Keep in-touch**:\nKeep the conversation going.

As enterprises continue to move to the cloud, security practitioners face new threats and paradigms. In this session, we\u2019ll forensically reconstruct major cloud-centric breaches and step through them, building an understanding of what happened, how it happened, and developing key takeaways to help secure our own infrastructure, especially in AWS, Azure, and GCP.\n\n**Code of Conduct:**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone. Please reach out to one of our chapter leaders if you have any feedback/concerns or would like to speak to us, we take these matters very seriously.

Thank you!\n\n**Agenda:**\n\n* 17:00-17:30 : Food\n* 17:30-17:50 : How to get pwned by npm packages and weak settings in GitHub Actions - Erlend \u00c5mdal\n* 18:00-18:45 : Open Policy Agent in-depth - Anders Eknert\n\n**How to get pwned by npm packages and weak settings in GitHub Actions**\nDo you know if your GitHub Actions workflows are secure? I will demonstrate a proof of concept of a supply chain attack that exploits weak security settings in a typical GitHub Actions workflow to do things you might not expect an npm package to be able to do, followed by a presentation of simple methods to prevent this kind of attack. Due to Action's tight integration with the rest of the GitHub platform, the attack can easily target a repository's contents and metadata, including the issue tracker, pull requests and GitHub Packages. If you value the content on your issue tracker or publish to GitHub Packages and are curious about the security of GitHub Actions, this presentation might prove interesting and useful.\n**Erlend \u00c5mdal** is a software development consultant at Blank with a few years of industry experience. He is a passionate developer who strives for secure software. Having worked with various customers ranging from reMarkable to Autodesk, Erlend has been involved with several organizations depending on GitHub Actions and npm packages for their CI/CD, and knows a thing or two about securing this dependency.\n\n**Open Policy Agent in-depth**\nShould user Alice be allowed to read credit reports? Should a cloud compute instance be deployable without basic security configuration in place? Should service X be allowed to query the database?\nPolicy defines the rules of our systems, but how do we ensure our policies are enforced consistently in increasingly distributed and diverse tech stacks?\nIn this technical talk we\u2019ll explore the benefits of decoupling policy from our applications, deployment pipelines and platforms, and how Open Policy Agent (OPA) and its policy language Rego works to unify policy enforcement across the whole stack.\n**Anders Eknert** is a developer advocate at Styra with a long background in software development, security and identity systems in primarily distributed environments. When not in front of his computer he enjoys watching football, cooking and Belgian beers."

In this talk, Adam will dive into residential proxies, tools that allow for requests from residential IP addresses. He'll clarify what these proxies are, who relies on them, and the possibilities they unlock. Additionally, he'll go over the process of how these large-scale proxy networks come to life.\n\nAdam will discuss the potential implications of these services on IP threat intelligence, the complications of carrier-grade NAT, and questions our reliance on geo-IP databases. He'll also shed light on how your internet use at home, school, or work might be effected by these services.\n\nFinally, Adam will touch on ongoing legal cases involving these services and reveal that some state actors are setting up their own proxy networks for data extraction purposes. The goal is to equip you with a comprehensive understanding of residential proxies, enabling you to make informed decisions within the field of internet security.\n\n**Here are the details of the event:**\n**Date:** July 11th 2023, 5:30pm\n**Venue**: Talenza, Level 3, Macquarie Place, Sydney\n\n**Schedule:**\n\n* 5.30 pm: Arrive, grab a drink, and meet your fellow attendees.\n* 6.00 pm: Residential Proxies Talk.\n* 6:30 pm: Q&A.\n* 7:00 pm: Networking.\n\n* 8:00 pm: Event ends\n\nRSVP now, and we'll see you there!\n\nBest regards,\nOWASP Sydney Chapter Committee"
