This\nworkshop aims to arm participants with practical knowledge and hands-on experience to secure\nAPIs effectively.\nIn this workshop, we will be using OWASP crAPI (completely ridiculous API), a purposely\ninsecure API, to demonstrate common API vulnerabilities and their mitigations. We will discuss\nthe 'Shift Left' approach in API security, emphasizing the importance of integrating security\nmeasures early in the development lifecycle. Participants will learn to identify, exploit, and\nsecure API vulnerabilities, equipping them with the necessary skills to build more secure\napplications\n\n**Presenter Bio:**\n1\\. Jayesh Ahire is the Product Manager at TraceableAI where he works on the Company\u2019s\nAPI Security initiative. He is the maintainer of OWASP crAPI, Hypertrace, and many\nother notable OSS Projects. He is AWS ML Hero, Twilio champion, and runs API\nSecurity Global Community. He also runs AWS UG, Elastic UG, TensorFlow UG, and\nmany other communities in US and India. His research interest involved Distributed\nneural computers and Defi. In his free time, he likes to read and these days he is\nlearning to play the piano.\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayesh-ahire/\n\n**Requirements**:\n1\\. Active Participation: The workshop will be highly interactive\\. Questions\\, comments\\, and\nsharing of experiences are strongly encouraged.\n2\\. Laptop: As this is an in\\-person workshop\\, please bring along your laptop with any API\ntesting tool installed.\n3\\. Pre\\-workshop Material: On confirmation of your attendance\\, you will receive some\npre-workshop reading materials. We recommend reviewing these before the event to\nmaximize your learning experience."

Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organisations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.\n\nThe **Cyber Security and Networking** (**CSN**) Research Group at Anglia Ruskin University has close working strategic relationships with industry, professional bodies, law enforcement, government agencies and academia in the delivery of operationally focused applied information and application security research. We have strong international links with professional organisations such as OWASP, BCS, ISC2, IISP & the UK Cyber Security Forum amongst others. The primary aims of CSNRG are to help the UK and partner nations to tackle cybercrime, be more resilient to cyber attacks and educate its users for a more secure cyberspace and operational business environment.\n\n**Abstract : \u201cOperation Poppins: An immersive Interactive case study driven approach\"**\n\nLike a lot of recent teaching developments, the pandemic and lockdowns forced us to re-evaluate how to deliver engaging remote content. Together with limited staffing resources there was an urgent operational requirement for case study driven teaching which kept a high level of interactive student engagement in a remote setting.\n\nThe success of the resources trialled during this period led to the development of an outreach course which successfully trialled a whodoneit style of immersive investigation throughout the entire module. The result included animated character videos, interactive online and in person exercises for each activity area, and a virtual crime scene for additional reflection and learning. By the end of the module the students had solved their first mini digital forensics case. The technique has proven so successful in outreach trials it has now been developed into a full module for postgraduate students.\n\nThis talk will briefly describe the development journey, the resulting module, and look at results from trials to date.\n\n**Provisional Agenda**\n\n16:45 - Webinar waiting lobby opens\n17:00 - Start of Presentation\n17:45 \u2013 Questions & Answers\n18:00 \u2013 Estimated Finish"

Here's what Jeff will be covering:\n\nAfter over 20 years, achieving app and API security still requires Herculean effort by smart and dedicated people. Fortunately, we can look to history and see a path forward. In the mid-2000s we changed the curve on kernel exploits by adding ASLR and DEP to operating systems. Imagine hardening your web app and web API stacks against all the major classes of vulnerability. You could instantly notify developers if they introduce a vulnerability and you could stop vulnerable software from being exploited. How would it change your appsec program if you could dramatically reduce the risk of all the common classes of vulnerability? In this talk, we\u2019ll explain how runtime protection works and how you can streamline vulnerability management and ensure your software doesn\u2019t get exploited\u2026 at the same time."

Zudem l\u00f6st es weitere gesamte Klassen an Fehlern wie z.B. NULL-Pointer-Dereferenzierung auf.\n\nRust ist bereits jetzt fester Bestandteil des Linux- und Windows-Kernels und wird f\u00fcr neue Komponenten in Android eingesetzt.\n\nDie Kombination aus Leistung, Sicherheit und nicht zuletzt einer tollen Community mit hohen sozialen Standards macht Rust zur Sprache der Wahl f\u00fcr moderne Programmierung.\n\nDer Vortrag gibt einen kurzen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die Programmiersprache Rust und soll zum Auszuprobieren anregen. Dazu gibt es einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Live-Coding Anteil um zu zeigen wie die Arbeit mit Rust aussieht und welche Konzepte die Sprache so besonders machen.\n\n**Generelles zum OWASP-Stammtisch**\n===\n\nBei unseren offenen Treffen geht es um Software und deren Sicherheit im Internet und/oder IT-Security allgemein. Es treffen sich Leute, die sich beruflich oder privat damit auseinandersetzen: Entwickler, Manager, \"Pentester\" und alle an (Web)sicherheit interessierte. Die Atmosph\u00e4re ist offen und locker.

A new and unique security condition has emerged that has no IOC\u2019s or TTP\u2019s. However, it is arguably the most dangerous of all emerging threats. If exploited, it can alter elections, destabilize governments, and bring a swift end to truth and the institutions that rely on truth. The future of information security is detecting and preventing the spread of \u201cdisinformation\u201d.\n\nPart 1 of this series focused on the origins of \u201cactive measures\u201d in the Cold War and the events leading up to January 6th 2021. Part 2 of this series, will focus on a new framework to map disinformation tactics and techniques, and the impact AI based chatbots and \u201cdeepfake\u201d technology will have on the future of democracy.\n\nWithout trust, democracy has no future. Can the security community help to restore trust in information and save democracy for posterity?\n\n**Schedule:**\n6:00pm - 6:40pm Networking, Food & Drink\n6:40pm - 6:45pm Welcome and Introduction\n6:45pm - 7:45pm Presentation & Q&A\n\n### **Code of Conduct**\n\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

In this talk, Adam will dive into residential proxies, tools that allow for requests from residential IP addresses. He'll clarify what these proxies are, who relies on them, and the possibilities they unlock. Additionally, he'll go over the process of how these large-scale proxy networks come to life.\n\nAdam will discuss the potential implications of these services on IP threat intelligence, the complications of carrier-grade NAT, and questions our reliance on geo-IP databases. He'll also shed light on how your internet use at home, school, or work might be effected by these services.\n\nFinally, Adam will touch on ongoing legal cases involving these services and reveal that some state actors are setting up their own proxy networks for data extraction purposes. The goal is to equip you with a comprehensive understanding of residential proxies, enabling you to make informed decisions within the field of internet security.\n\n**Here are the details of the event:**\n**Date:** July 11th 2023, 5:30pm\n**Venue**: Talenza, Level 3, Macquarie Place, Sydney\n\n**Schedule:**\n\n* 5.30 pm: Arrive, grab a drink, and meet your fellow attendees.\n* 6.00 pm: Residential Proxies Talk.\n* 6:30 pm: Q&A.\n* 7:00 pm: Networking.\n\n* 8:00 pm: Event ends\n\nRSVP now, and we'll see you there!\n\nBest regards,\nOWASP Sydney Chapter Committee"
