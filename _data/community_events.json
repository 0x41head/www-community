        "description": "We're excited to host Dr. Baljeet Malhotra (Founder/CEO of TeejLab) for a 1 hour session on API Security.\n\nPlease join us for this guest session.\n\nBelow is a talk abstract:\n\nIt is known that 96% of applications are built using some Open Source [Black Duck]. Furthermore, 99% of those Open Source applications contain some Web APIs [TeejLab]. It\u2019s not surprising that Akamai estimated that 83% of the internet traffic today is via Web APIs that connect digital applications at a global scale. The growing API usage impacts organizations both positively (through innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, etc.) and negatively (due to security vulnerabilities, business disruptions, legal and compliance issues etc.). Gartner has predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at enterprises, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs by managing API risks proactively. This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework to manage API security and legal risks. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can adopt for effective API Risk Management. We\u2019ll highlight best practices, both manual and automated, with relevant tool recommendations.\n\nTopic: OWASP Abu Dhabi Chapter: Zero Trust Model for API Security and Legal Risk Management\nTime: Feb 5, 2022 10:00 AM Dubai"

Any business with a mobile app, modern web apps (SPAs), using the cloud, doing a digital transformation, integrating with business partners, running microservices or using kubernetes has APIs. There's a good foundation of AppSec knowledge out there - thanks in part to OWASP but API Security isn't exactly the same as AppSec. Additional complexity is part of the landscape with multiple competing API technologies like REST, gRPC and GraphQL plus stakeholders spread across multiple parts of the business. How to do you make sense of API Security landscape? This talk will cover the three fundamental areas to consider, the various chess pieces and the many ways those pieces can be put on your API chessboard. The goal is for you to leave knowing how to map out your API Security landscape and reach a state of solid API Security.\n\nBIO: Matt Tesauro is a DevSecOps and AppSec guru with specialization in creating security programs, leveraging automation to maximize team velocity and training emerging and senior professionals. When not writing automation code in Go, Matt is pushing for DevSecOps everywhere via his involvement in open-source projects, presentations, trainings and new technology innovation.\n\nAs a versatile engineer, Matt\u2019s background spans software development (primarily web development), Linux system administration, penetration testing and application / cloud security. He thrives on tackling technical problems, but his economics background gives him a unique understanding of business constraints and incentives around security initiatives.\n\nCurrently, as a Distinguished Engineer at Noname Security, Matt is evangelizing Noname\u2019s ground-breaking API security platform and API security in general. Previously, he rolled out AppSec automation at USAA and founded 10Security. Early in his career, Matt served as Director of Community and Operations at the OWASP Foundation, Senior AppSec Engineer at Duo Security, Senior Software Security Engineer at Pearson and Senior Product Security Engineer at Rackspace.\n\nMeeting info will be available on meetup - BE SURE TO RSVP to access the link\n\nATTENTION SPONSORS: YOUR NAME COULD BE HERE\nContact sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

Many of us are conditioned to believe we need to be cynical in order to be secure. In George's award-winning book, Well Aware, he demonstrates that the opposite is true...we can hack our own brain's \"habit loop\" to make being more secure easy. George will provide a roadmap on how to use the science behind habits that can help make security possible for anyone.\nAttendees will be able to:\n\u2022 Identify their own top internal and external cybersecurity strengths\n\u2022 Understand how habits play a role in helping us become more secure\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nGeorge Finney is a Chief Information Security Officer that believes that people are the key to solving our cybersecurity challenges. George is the bestselling author of several cybersecurity books, including the award-winning book, Well Aware: Master the Nine Cybersecurity Habits to Protect Your Future. George was recognized in 2021 as one of the top 100 CISOs in the world by CISOs Connect and has worked in Cybersecurity for over 20 years and has helped startups, global telecommunications firms, and nonprofits improve their security posture.\n\nNOTE: Due to the continuing health concerns relating to the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we will be meeting virtually until further notice."

Bring your laptop.\n\nSpeaker: Vickie Li, Developer Evangelist at ShiftLeft\n\nTitle: Analyzing source code for vulnerabilities: A how-to workshop\n\nAbstract:\nWriting code is hard. Writing secure code is even harder. Serious security vulnerabilities often stem from small programming mistakes. As developers, we can safeguard our applications by catching these mistakes in our own code.\n\nPerforming a source code review is one of the best ways to find security issues in code. But how do you do it? In this workshop, we will first go through the basics of how to review your code for vulnerabilities and some tactics for performing an effective security code review on your application.\n\nBut the process of manually analyzing code for vulnerabilities can be very time-consuming. In the second part of this talk, we will also talk about how to use the interactive code analysis tool Joern to make code analysis more efficient. How do you effectively trace user input in code? How can you efficiently link bug sources to sensitive sink functions?"
