        "description": "Please join us for OWASP Boston's December meetup! For those attending in-person, the doors open at 6pm, and those joining us virtually the presentation will start at 6:30pm.\n\nThis month we will be welcoming Tommaso Innocenti to talk about his research on OAuth2.0 redirection URIs.\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\nTommaso is a fourth-year Ph.D. student advised by Engin Kirda, working as a Secure Systems Lab (SecLab) member at Northeastern University. His interests revolve around Privacy and Security, with particular attention to increasing final users' security. His works reflect his passion and tenacity in exploring complex security topics. His most recent work focuses on the security of the OAuth protocol.\n\nABSTRACT\nOAuth 2.0 requires a complex redirection trail between websites and Identity Providers (IdPs). In particular, the \"redirect URI\" parameter included in the popular Authorization Grant Code flow governs the callback endpoint to which users are routed, together with their security tokens.\n\nIn this talk, I will present recent attack trends in conjunction with the research trends to identify the source of the problem that allowed us to generate our hypothesis.\n\nBased on this observation, I will present novel attack techniques and the experiment that allowed us to verify that the OAuth 2.0 security guidance is under-specified empirically. Finally, I will explain end-to-end attack scenarios that combine our attack techniques with common web application vulnerabilities, ultimately resulting in a complete compromise of the secure delegated access that OAuth 2.0 promises."

In this presentation we highlight the risks of staying with the ancient (roughly 2019-2021) \u201ccurrent\u201d best practices. The current (circa 2022) BCPs bring many changes, such as deprecation of the implicit flow, required usage of PKCE and the BFF pattern which mitigates some of the previous attack vectors. It takes time for new concepts to fully mature and secure defaults emerge. While following the latest BCPs it\u2019s still possible to make mistakes and end up with a broken implementation. This presentation will show some common OAuth2/OIDC security pitfalls and why it is bad practice to use reverse proxy catch-all routing in your BFF, an OAuth2 client with access to many scopes, together with APIs that do authorization based on just a valid token and scopes. Does your BFF enable authenticated SSRF as a Service? During the presentation we will demonstrate both attacks and defences for a OAuth2/OIDC application running locally.\n**Pontus Hanssen** in an experienced security researcher and penetration tester. He loves to hack everything that blinks or has an IP address. Pontus performs security reviews and penetration tests as part of Omegapoint Cybersecurity Gothenburg, a group of experts in application security.\n**Tobias Ahnoff** is an experienced developer and architect with focus on application security. He specializes in implementing authentication flows and authorization for web applications and APIs that manage sensitive data. Tobias performs security reviews and penetration tests as part of Omegapoint Cybersecurity Gothenburg, a group of experts in application security. He also gives courses in application security and is an appreciated speaker in OAuth2 and OpenID Connect areas.\n\n**18:30 - 19:15:** Food\n\n**19:15 - 20:00:** *Pentesting War Stories*\nWorking in penetration testing generates quite a few interesting stories\nabout spectacular vulnerabilities found in tested systems.\nOften these stories are not shared outside of a small circle of people.\nThis presentation goes through a selection of vulnerabilities found\nduring assignments in the recent years. The titles of the stories are:\n\u201cThe omnipotent client cert\u201d (automotive app), \u201cNext level XSS\u201c (web),\nNo route to boat\u201d (network), and \u201dHaving a conversation with a door\nhandle\" (embedded).\n**Emilie Barse** is an experienced IT security consultant with a deep\ninterest in security testing and log analysis. She has worked in IT\nsecurity since 2005 and has worked in numerous different industries, and has tested applications, networks, cloud environments, IoT systems, and cars. Emilie has a PhD in computer security from Chalmers University of Technology.\n\n**20:00 - 21:30:** Over-time (optional)\nHang out, grab something to drink, and discuss security, the weather or anything in between!"

Please note that all our events are live-streamed on YouTube for the online audience. Recordings will be available on the OWASP London YouTube channel.**\n\n**Venue Location**: Thought Machine, 7 Herbrand St, London WC1N 1EX\n**Nearest Tube:** Russell Square (Piccadilly Line) - 2 min walk\n**Doors Open at 6pm** for registration, pizza, drinks and networking. The talks start at 6:30pm (we start on time).\n\n**TALKS**\n\n**OWASP Introduction, Welcome and News** \\- Sam Stepanyan\n\n**\"E2E Detection Testing\"** \\- George Gilligan\n\nHow do you make sure your detections work in a cloud native organisation? Software engineers have integration tests, reliability engineers have chaos engineering frameworks. Detection engineers lack an equivalent standardised approach to E2E testing. A natural approach is a binary that generates a suspicious event, validates that a suitable alert is generated in your SIEM, closes it, and reports the result. An open source Datadog tool named Threatest does just this. We are working on extending this to work with Elasticsearch, with the hope of automating a huge portion of the work of the red team, and providing constant validation for our detections.\n\n**\"5 Open Source Security Tools All Developers Should Know About\"** \\- Raz Probstein\n\nThe minimum viable security (MVS) approach, enables us to easily bake security into our config files, apps, and CI/CD processes with a few simple controls - and the great part? It\u2019s easily achievable through open-source tooling. In this talk we will focus on five critical security controls that will be integrated as part of the CI/CD pipeline by leveraging some excellent open source tools in addition to custom controls to ensure proper enforcement of MFA via Github Security. These controls will provide a foundational framework for securing your applications from the first line of code, which will make it possible to continuously iterate and evolve your security maturity all the way through advanced layers of security that come with time, as well as increased experience with your deployments, stacks, and security posture. Code examples & demos will be showcased as part of this session.\n\n**\"I Will IDOR Myself In\"** \\- Vangelis Stykas\n\nHow could attackers gain control of hundreds of million devices? In this talk Vangelis explains how attackers can exploit a series of simple, yet critical API flaws that are typical \u201crush to market\u201d flaws which allow an attacker to control and even use them as an initial foothold in millions of networks. Devices vary from routers to alarms and car chargers. It seems that the era of \u201ccentral platform\u201d handling that solves a variety of problems (like port forwarding) backfired by re-introducing a number of vulnerabilities that were thought to be long gone.\n\n**SPEAKERS**\n\n**George Gilligan (@ggilligan12)**\nGeorge Gilligan is a security engineer at Thought Machine, where his work includes securing Kubernetes clusters, container security, intrusion detection, security testing, and implementing security policies. George participates in various CTF competitions and his CTF achievements include the Deloitte CTF Qualifier, Scottish Universities Cybersecurity Challenge and Hack Harvard 2018.\nGeorge holds an Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification and a BSc (Honours) degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Edinburgh.\n\n**Raz Probstein (@RazProbstein)**\nRaz comes with years of experience in both leadership and technology, having served not only as Young Ambassador to the state of Israel, as well as headhunted and selected as Young Researcher at the prestigious Weizmann Institute for multi-disciplinary scientific research. Today she serves as a Solution Engineer at Jit, coming to the role with years of experience as a FullStack Engineer and years of experience in a diversity of programming languages from Python, to Javascript and C/C#, from the elite IDF unit 81.\n\n**Vangelis Stykas** (@evstykas)\nVangelis is a Chief Technology Officer at Atropos, and during his free time, Vangelis is helping start-ups secure themselves on the internet.\n\n**TICKETS**\nThis event is free to attend for both members and non-members of OWASP and is open to anyone interested in web application and cyber security. Please note that you MUST book your place to be admitted to the event by the building security - your name will be checked against the guest list.\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone. Please reach out to one of our chapter leaders if you have any feedback/concerns or would like to speak to us, we take these matters very seriously.

Learn From Others in the DevOps and DevSecOps Communities\nLook to the DevOps community to help close your critical knowledge gaps.\n2. 2\\. Start With Your Container Security\nThe first step to building out the security of your DevOps toolchain starts with your container security.\n3. Institute Continuous Compliance\nDevSecOps is a platform for continuous compliance to protect your software supply chains against vulnerable packages and vulnerable configurations.\n4. Double Down on Automation\nWhile you may have already been experimenting with automation during your DevOps phase, it only becomes more integral once you throw the switch in by going DevSecOps. Go into your DevOps to DevSecOps transformation with an automation strategy that focuses on automating common developer and sysadmin tasks.\n5. Improve Your Monitoring and Analytics\nBuilding out a DevSecOps toolchain takes your monitoring and analytics options to a new level. Consider the fact that you should already collect and publish data from your toolchain and deliver reports to your project managers, developers, QA testers, and stakeholders outside your team. Commonly, DevOps reporting is still a work in progress for organizations. Use the introduction of new security tools into your toolchain as a chance to offer more granular and real-time security reporting into all parts of your DevSecOps toolchain.\n6. Implement Accessibility Assurance\nDepending on your organization\u2019s definition of compliance, the option is there to add accessibility compliance or Section 508 to your DevSecOps toolchain.\n\nThis hands-on training is reserver for 70% professional and 30% students.\n\nMandatory:\n\nGeneral Conditions in order to validate your participation to this event:\n\n1\\. Student must send University/Student ID\\, otherwise registration will be rejected\\.\n\n2.Professional must register company emails, otherwise registration will be rejected.\n\nRegistration only via EventBrite. We don't accept answer via meetup.\n\nPlease indicate your firstname, lastname, company name, a valid business email or school email (email like gmai, free, hotmail, outlook, etc are not accepted and registration will be cancelled).\n\nPlease register here:\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/billets-devsecops-toolchain-transformation-374188276207"
