Runtime security tools don\u2019t understand SCA findings, and don\u2019t come in until production. What if you could marry SCA with runtime analysis during dev, test, and prod?\n\nIn this session, Kiran Kamity, Founder and CEO of Deepfactor, will discuss how the next generation of AppSec needs to go beyond just integrating static SCA into your CI pipeline, to analyzing insecure behaviors inside running apps and correlating that back to SCA to understand which vulnerable components are actually loaded into memory and used by your application. This new approach to AppSec will detect both known vulnerabilities/CVEs with SCA scans and unknown vulnerabilities with runtime analysis. It will then prioritize known vulnerabilities with runtime correlation of SCA findings. End result: you catch most of the key risks in your app, prioritize the key items your devs need to work on without flooding them with alerts, and remove unused components from your containers to burn down your CVE debt rapidly. And achieve the true mission of AppSec\u2026to empower engineering and security teams to create secure applications."

As we reflect on the past year's achievements, we're excited to kick off a series of meetups that will lead us into the highly anticipated OWASP Global AppSec Lisbon Event. This first meetup of the series will set the stage for an incredible journey towards building more secure applications and connecting with fellow appsec enthusiasts.\n\nThe meetup takes place on November 15th, 2023, at 18:00, at the OLX office, and is **sponsored by OLX and AP2SI**.\n\nThe schedule is the following:\n18:00 - **The Cake** by the OWASP Lisboa chapter leadership team\n18:15 - **Seeing What\u2019s Wrong Just Right** by Jasvir Nagra\n19:10 - **Why everyone in your cyber security team needs to be an AI expert** by Dinis Cruz\n20:00 - **Drinks & Dinner** by OLX\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n**Talks**:\n\nTitle: **Seeing What\u2019s Wrong Just Right**\n\nSpeaker: **Jasvir Nagra**\n\nAbstract:\nWriting web applications is hard. Debugging them is harder. Security bugs are even harder because not only does an application have to work, it has to stop working when the input is malicious. One approach web developers have taken to managing the complexity of writing large web programs is to make it harder to write incorrect programs. Static type checkers, linters, tests and testing frameworks have all made it easier to write correct code. Nevertheless, incorrect and vulnerable programs still exist. In fact, the very success of these tools in avoiding common errors has meant developers spend increasing amounts of time debugging only subtle bugs. In distributed systems, the challenge is even harder because debugging tools give you glimpses into the program state\u2014some on the server, some on the client\u2014without giving you a coherent view of the entire system. Not only are web programs inherently distributed between the server and the client, any one web page in the browser is itself made up of different iframes, events and event handlers, and sometimes service workers all communicating asynchronously. In this talk, I will share a few painful distributed web app debugging anecdotes and an alternate approach to get a holistic view of a program to track down elusive bugs. This approach uses virtualization to create complete traces of just those aspects of the program we suspect are buggy without having to model all program state. Virtualization allows us to momentarily ignore incidental bugs discovered while hunting the core one without it getting in the way, and visualization of the collected traces to build up causal diagrams to inform our intuition when our mental models deviate from reality. I will demonstrate how to recognize and tackle debugging problems with this approach and cover pitfalls you may run into with virtualization.\n\nBio:\nJasvir Nagra is widely recognized as a thought leader in software protection. He is co-author of Surreptitious Software, the definitive textbook on software protection, and an early researcher in obfuscation, software watermarking, and fingerprinting. With more than 12 years of experience, his professional path includes companies such as Instart, Dropbox and Google - where he led the Caja project. As an advisor to Jscrambler, he is helping cybersecurity startups address key technological challenges.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nTitle: **Why everyone in your cyber security team needs to be an AI expert**\n\nSpeaker: **Dinis Cruz**\n\nAbstract:\nSimilar to how electricity revolutionised our lives and is now ubiquitous, Gen AI is poised to become an integral part of everything Cyber Security teams do everyday. Therefore, there is an increasing need to deepen our understanding and expertise in this transformative technology. It's time to embrace the opportunities AI presents and equip ourselves with the knowledge to thrive in this rapidly evolving landscape.\n\nBio:\nDinis Cruz is the Chief Scientist of Glasswall and the CISO of Holland & Barrett, who brings a unique blend of Security and Engineering expertise with 20+ years experience in Cyber Security and Software Development. Dinis is focused on creating Gen AI powered teams and environments where engineering and security are enablers and accelerators for the business, with a big focus on the productisation and commercialisation of advanced technologies."

DevOps, DevSecOps, Agile, CI/CD pipeline, etc., and chances are you have heard these terms when discussing the software development life cycle. What do those terms mean? With the recent increasing cyber-attacks on software such as in-house developed code or software supply chain (open source software), the traditional ways of decreasing the attack surface on software applications no longer work effectively. Moreover, organizations are pressured to develop code faster and cheaper to meet customer demands. Mary will explain what DevSecOps is and how this practice is better than DevOps in security. In addition, how CI/CD fits in DevSecOps. Lastly, the popular tools are used in DevSecOps practices. She will provide the real-world experience challenges that she encountered.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: *[SAFEBASE](https://safebase.io/)*\n*SafeBase is the customer-facing Trust Center that automates B2B security reviews. Companies like LinkedIn, Asana, OpenAI, and Snyk use SafeBase to reduce security questionnaires, create a better buying experience, accelerate sales velocity, and position security as a revenue driver.*\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available** *Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to* *sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.
