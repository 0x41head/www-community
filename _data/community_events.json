By signing up, you accept that OWASP Aarhus will hand over a list of participants to Cryptomathic for the sole purpose of hosting this event.</p> <p>19:00 - 19:30<br/>\"Welcome, Food and Drinks\"<br/>Thomas Ljungberg Kristensen - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus<br/>Dennis Perto - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus</p> <p>19:30 - 20:15<br/>\"Mobile Security: App Attestation and keeping secrets on the phone\"<br/>Peter \u00d8rb\u00e6k, Software Engineer at Cryptomathic</p> <p>About the presentation:<br/>\"Mobile app security is about two things: protecting secrets (password, tokens, keys) on the phone, and ensuring the backend that it is talking the genuine app and user. This talk is about how Cryptomathic solved this and the path which lead to App Attestation and the Cryptomathic Mobile App Security Core.\"</p> <p>About Peter:<br/>My name is Peter \u00d8rb\u00e6k. I have a Ph.D in computer science from the University of Aarhus. Since 2010 I have worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Cryptomathic on key management, authentication, document signing, and not least, mobile security in the banking world.</p> <p>20:30 - 21:15<br/>\"Cryptography and it\u2019s flaws in practice\"<br/>Marcus Sellebjerg, Student at Aarhus university with a passion for cybersecurity and cryptography</p> <p>About the presentation:<br/>It\u2019s widely acceptable that security on the internet is very important. Still many developers doesn\u2019t know how to implement security mechanisms and particularly cryptography is a very error prone area. For many cryptography is a black box of math-magic and while that is fine, it\u2019s important to use this black box in a correct manner which is sadly not easy. In this talk I\u2019ll give you an introduction on how to use the cryptography black box and how it can be exploited if not used correct.</p> <p>About Marcus:<br/>My name is Marcus, I\u2019m currently a masters student at Aarhus University with a huge interest in cryptography and the math behind it. Beside university I compete in capture the flag tournaments together with my team (Kalmarunionen), where we look at different security solutions and tries to circumvent the implemented security mechanisms, both crypto and other areas. I also work in the cryptography department of Danske bank and have been programming since I was around the age of 12, where the concept of hiding information in plain sight also found my interest.</p> <p>21:15 - 21:30<br/>Goodbyes and plans going forward<br/>Thomas Ljungberg Kristensen - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus<br/>Dennis Perto - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus</p> "

And when there are recalls of certain ingredients it\u2019s nice to quickly know whether those ingredients are already in your cupboard. Software Bills of Materials enable you to know what\u2019s in the software you consider procuring, and let you quickly know what\u2019s already inside your organization. Of course, you can even use them to understand the risk in the portfolio of software your organization baked itself! Since the May Executive Order on Improving the Nation\u2019s Cybersecurity SBOMs have gotten a lot more attention, but what does it really mean for an organization to make the most of this capability? This talk will help you prepare your organization for the near future when generating, evaluating, and leveraging SBOMs will be expected.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Greg Mohler is a Manager within KPMG's Cyber Defense practice, and has spent the past four years helping over 20 clients solve difficult problems related to DevSecOps, Application Security, and Vulnerability Management.

Similarly, CSA's IoT Working group is dedicated to understanding IoT deployments and defining actionable guidance to secure ecosystems. Their efforts are often used to develop medical security guidelines for developers and manufacturers alike but also to influence IoT security assessment methodologies for later use on commercial IoT certification schemes.

Maybe it is better not to put it in your code, nor in your container. But what about Kubernetes? What about a custom secrets storage solution? Of course, we tried many, sometimes funny, things to get our secrets secured. And luckily we ended up with a combination of safe methods, with Vault at its core. Want to know more? Join us, as we will go through various examples and their challenges!</p> <p>Jeroen Willemsen is a Principal Security Architect at Xebia and a jack of all trades in security. He loves to develop new software, set up DevSecOps support tooling, and help companies with security programs. He enjoys sharing knowledge, which is why he published articles, blogs and gave trainings and talks about various subjects.</p> <p>Doing Security in DevOps, the right way!</p> <p>Automation is not DevSecOps, but without automation there is no DevSecOps! Secret management, SAST, DAST, Pen Testing, Container Security, Secure Config Management etc. are about automating security. But let me ask you, can one reach nirvana in securing DevOps with solely automation? This talk will address ALL dimensions required for doing security in DevOps, so we get it right!</p> <p>Irfaan Santoe is a Global Security Director at Wolters Kluwer advising the Business &amp; IT on the information security ambition &amp; implementation. Prior to Wolters Kluwer, Irfaan was the Global Head of Security Engineering at ABN AMRO bank and lead the security implementation of ABN AMRO\u2019s IT transformation towards DevOps. This transformation program is set to uplift more than 500+ Dev-teams to become DevOps and increasing security without breaking DevOps! Irfaan is a Master in Computer Science (a programmer by heart) and is fascinated by the Inner Science of Yoga &amp; Meditation.</p> "

Writing secure code is even harder. Serious security vulnerabilities often stem from small programming mistakes. As developers, we can safeguard our applications by catching these mistakes in our own code.</p> <p>Performing a source code review is one of the best ways to find security issues in code. But how do you do it? In this workshop, we will first go through the basics of how to review your code for vulnerabilities and some tactics for performing an effective security code review on your application.</p> <p>But the process of manually analyzing code for vulnerabilities can be very time-consuming. In the second part of this talk, we will also talk about how to use the interactive code analysis tool Joern to make code analysis more efficient. How do you effectively trace user input in code? How can you efficiently link bug sources to sensitive sink functions? If you\u2019d like to follow along, here is what you need to get ready.</p> <p>Joern is open-sourced, download Joern and install:<br/>$ wget <a href=\"https://github.com/joernio/joern/releases/latest/download/joern-install.sh\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/joernio/joern/releases/latest/download/joern-install.sh</a><br/>$ chmod +x ./joern-install.sh<br/>$ sudo ./joern-install.sh</p> <p>If you need help here are some important links:<br/>Joern Community: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/ff3ahcFrJq\" class=\"linkified\">https://discord.gg/ff3ahcFrJq</a><br/>Joern Documentation: <a href=\"https://docs.joern.io\" class=\"linkified\">https://docs.joern.io</a><br/>Joern query database: <a href=\"https://queries.joern.io\" class=\"linkified\">https://queries.joern.io</a></p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Vickie Li is the resident developer evangelist at ShiftLeft.
