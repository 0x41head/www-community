The standards describes both technical and process-related aspects.\nAgenda:\n\\- Overview of the standards\n\\- How we defined the security program for improving cyber security in our deliveries\n\\- What is the outcome of the first large step\\, leading to process descriptions and the first certificate of compliance\n\\- What are the next steps\n\\- What are our experiences with the standards\\, implementation and certification process\n\nAbout Claus:\nAfter some years as a developer/architect I focused on management and security, and was for some years department manager leading sales, development and operation of security products and services. In that role I have been responsible for ISO 27001 and GDPR process implementation and certifications.\nAfter joining BEUMER in 2020, I'm responsible for the security in our SW deliveries.\n\nA large part of my job is defining and managing our security program, including Secure Development Lifecycle processes with a virtual team of experts.\n\nI believe I have the necessary patience and persistence and enjoy when my colleagues also see the light of security and processes.\nI have an old master in computer science from AU, followed much later by a diploma in management and latest CISSP and CCSK exams.\n\n**20:00 - 20:45 \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" by Helge Jensen, Full vertical leader: Business, Technology and Cyber Security**\n\nAbout Helge:\nHelge Jensen has built two software consultancies business around data and cyber-security in the energy industries, and is now an angel investor and independent consultant helping change culture and performance of operational security in large enterprises.\n\nAbout the presentation:\nThe session \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" will leave you better prepared for your Cyber Security journey. We will zoom in to specifics via some of the major challenges using IEC62443 (and other standards) to improve cyber security in a frank and direct style. The talk will serve several observations collected in practical settings in the energy industry, and allow raising some of those burning and hard questions.\n\n20:45 - 21:00\nGoodbyes and plans going forward by OWASP Chapter Aarhus"

I will discuss technical details and explain the different use cases that might benefit you, from blue team using Sysmon and Cilium/Tetragon to achieve super powerful abilities, to researchers building custom program tracers, to red team exploiting kernel vulns, to sysadmins seeking performance issues.\n\nIt is a truly exciting thing that everyone is talking about.\n\nBio: Kev Sheldrake is a security software engineer and researcher who started working in the technical security field in 1997. Over the years, Kev has been a developer and systems administrator of \u2018secure\u2019 systems, an infosec policy consultant, a penetration tester, a reverse engineer and an entrepreneur who founded and ran his own security consulting company. He currently works at Isovalent on the open source and enterprise versions of the system observability tool Tetragon, and in the past he specialised in IoT, crypto, and tool development for a number of years.\nTwitter: [@kevsecurity](https://twitter.com/kevsecurity)"

With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scales.\nEstablishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, light-weight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n**BIO**: Cassio Goldschmidt is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at ServiceTitan and an operating advisor at Bessemer. He is also an investor, startup advisor, MBA mentor, regular speaker at conferences, long-time contributor to the security community, and an award-winning technology executive.\n\n**Sponsor**: Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

        "description": "**Location:** Utrecht\n\n**More information:** To be announced shortly.\n\n18:00 - 18:15 - **Reception of attendees**\n18:15 - 19:00 - **Food and beverages**\n19:00 - 19:15 - **Welcome and OWASP updates**\n19:15 - 20:00 - **Attacking and Defending Kubernetes** by **Akshit Sharma** and **Mauricio Cano**\n20.00 - 20:15 - **Break with drinks**\n20:15 - 21:00 - **Second talk**\n\n**Attacking and Defending Kubernetes**\nOrganizations are increasingly moving to cloud-based managed Kubernetes deployments given the numerous benefits over self-managed deployments. However, it comes with different security and monitoring considerations. The reason behind these differences lies in the different management models used by different cloud service providers, which most of the time depend on the proposed Shared Responsibility Model.\n\nThis talk discusses some common security misconfigurations for Kubernetes clusters and how attackers can exploit them via live demonstrations. We will then focus on a custom cloud-native security monitoring solution built in AWS. The goal is to alert relevant stakeholders of potential misconfigurations and active breach attempts on an Amazon EKS Cluster. As mentioned above, this talk includes **live demonstrations** of some of the use-cases that have been implemented. The implemented solution leverages AWS native tools, as well as an infrastructure-as-code template for rapid deployment across accounts. Finally, we discuss potential use cases for this solution and propose a general roadmap for improvements and future capabilities.\nThis talk will be especially useful for individual contributors or professionals who want to understand and develop in-house security monitoring tools for Kubernetes without the need for expensive third-party platforms.\n\n*Akshit Sharma:*\nAkshit is a cyber security consultant focused on Cloud Security and DevSecOps. He has over six years of experience working with numerous clients in different industries. He has focused on conceiving, designing, and implementing security programs with special focus on building integrations and automation accelerators. He was the lead implementer of a cloud-native security monitoring solution for one of the largest Dutch financial institutions. His academic background is in the field of Information Technology. Outside work Akshit likes delving into the topic of international relations, going on hikes, listening to music, traveling and enjoying good food.\n\n*Mauricio Cano:*\nMauricio Cano is a cloud pentester focused on container technologies. In particular, he focuses on the security of containers and serverless architectures. He has pentested Kubernetes clusters and serverless architectures for several multinational financial institutions. Prior to his security work, he has a background in academia and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Groningen, focused on programming language design and formal methods to ensure correctness. In his spare time, Cano enjoys reading, cooking, and solving puzzles."

We will be testing against OWASP\u2019s Juice Shop that will be hosted in the cloud, so participants will be able to get some hands-on experience. Slides of the presentation will be provided, as well as links to resources to continue learning.\n\n**Shane Kell:**\nI started with NetSPI this past January in the NetSPI U program, getting a crash course in Web Application testing for 6 months, and currently work as a Security Consultant testing Web Applications for various clients.\n\nDuring the pandemic I upskilled in several ways. I used TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and TCM to learn and practice new skills. I also found ways to add developing my cyber security skillset to my development plan at work, and this was how I was able to participate in a Vuln Hub hacking group that was hosted by Nike\u2019s Red Team when I was a contractor there. They run it like a book club for hackers, picking a new vuln box every two weeks, show newcomers the ropes, and work on more advanced topics depending on the box that is selected. I also have an associate degree in Computer Information Systems and do my share of hacking on my own time. I am currently learning how to deconstruct, tweak, and recompile Android apps, and how to breach and move laterally within the Active Directory environment.\n\nThere are many free or reasonably priced Cyber Security resources available, and I am happy to share what I know of them."
