        "description": "A standing premise in engineering and security is that in order to be secure you have to have all security patches applied and your software be up to date. This advice seems obviously correct but can also be the source of a lot of frustration, cost and fragility in production systems. Security patches often have to be rushed out, can be poorly tested, sometimes subtly change behavior and can cause performance, availability and even security problems to get introduced. Not only that, when vulnerabilities occur in third party systems, your ability to patch or upgrade can be dependent on a vendor or a party you don\u2019t control.\n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) and the use of containers and orchestration complicated matters by forcing patching to any part of the application or infrastructure cause a full application build. For smaller sized apps, this isn\u2019t really relevant, but it\u2019s a real problem for apps that take hours to build and even more to test before being able to deploy again. This can highly discourage people from patching as fast as they can. Automated patching isn\u2019t the answer as well, as the risk of breaking the application is too high. So, certainly, there must be another way.\n\nWhat alternatives are there then? In this talk, we will argue that an alternative is to use sandboxing and isolation to limit the blast radius of exploits. We will also look at three different examples in networking, in server side rendering and a web client on how you can architecture a system using sandboxing and isolation so that while patching remains necessary, the need to rush a patch out can be mitigated.\n\nHopefully, this talk can help security professionals better strategize how they spend their efforts to find a balance between finding and fixing vulnerabilities and patching them - and deploying mitigation or attenuation mechanisms assuming that no one can ever aspire to be 100% secure.\n\n----\nPedro Fortuna Bio\nCTO and Co-Founder at Jscrambler\n\nOnce on a trajectory to a full academic career, where he taught security and computer science courses for about 5 years - ended up falling in love with the fast-paced world of entrepreneurship.

This\nworkshop aims to arm participants with practical knowledge and hands-on experience to secure\nAPIs effectively.\nIn this workshop, we will be using OWASP crAPI (completely ridiculous API), a purposely\ninsecure API, to demonstrate common API vulnerabilities and their mitigations. We will discuss\nthe 'Shift Left' approach in API security, emphasizing the importance of integrating security\nmeasures early in the development lifecycle. Participants will learn to identify, exploit, and\nsecure API vulnerabilities, equipping them with the necessary skills to build more secure\napplications\n\n**Presenter Bio:**\n1\\.

        "description": "We are happy to announce our July meetup. Thanks to our hosts FOSSA Inc. Please come and attend some awesome talks with some great food and drinks.\n\n**Talk #1 Quantifying Application Security**\nAbstract:\nWhy are application security concerns important? The security industry is increasingly using cyber risk quantification to express risks in business language. We will cover the tools, techniques, and methods used to measure risk and make informed decisions within security and the business at large. This includes an overview of Monte Carlo, Metalog Distributions, OPEN FAIR analysis, causal models, and other techniques/ tools.\n\nSpeaker:- Daniel ONeil, CEO Privacy labs\n\n**Talk#2: AppSec 2.0: Reimagine AppSec With Runtime Analysis**\nAbstract:\nSCA tools (container and dependency scans) generate too much noise. Runtime security tools don\u2019t understand SCA findings, and don\u2019t come in until production. What if you could marry SCA with runtime analysis during dev, test, and prod?\n\nIn this session, Kiran Kamity, CEO and Founder of Deepfactor, will discuss how the next generation of AppSec needs to go beyond just integrating static SCA into your CI pipeline, to analyzing insecure behaviors inside running apps and correlating that back to SCA to understand which vulnerable components are actually loaded into memory and used by your application. This new approach to AppSec will detect both known vulnerabilities/CVEs with SCA scans and unknown vulnerabilities with runtime analysis. It will then prioritize known vulnerabilities with runtime correlation of SCA findings. End result: you catch most of the key risks in your app, prioritize the key items your devs need to work on without flooding them with alerts, and remove unused components from your containers to burn down your CVE debt rapidly\u2026.and achieve the true mission of AppSec\u2026to empower engineering and security teams to create secure applications.\n\nSpeaker:- Kiran Kamity is the Founder & CEO of Deepfactor. He is a serial Silicon Valley entrepreneur with a passion for building products that meet a need and make a business impact\u2014with Deepfactor that\u2019s empowering engineering teams to create secure cloud native applications. Prior to Deepfactor, Kiran was the Head of Product at Cisco Cloud BU, Founder/CEO at ContainerX (acquired by Cisco), and the Founder/VP at RingCube (acquired by Citrix). Kiran is a TEDx speaker and loves nature, travel, and food."

Here's what Jeff will be covering:\n\nAfter over 20 years, achieving app and API security still requires Herculean effort by smart and dedicated people. Fortunately, we can look to history and see a path forward. In the mid-2000s we changed the curve on kernel exploits by adding ASLR and DEP to operating systems. Imagine hardening your web app and web API stacks against all the major classes of vulnerability. You could instantly notify developers if they introduce a vulnerability and you could stop vulnerable software from being exploited. How would it change your appsec program if you could dramatically reduce the risk of all the common classes of vulnerability? In this talk, we\u2019ll explain how runtime protection works and how you can streamline vulnerability management and ensure your software doesn\u2019t get exploited\u2026 at the same time."

This Is Fine \u2013 Red Team Edition**\n*Firat Acar & Moritz Thomas*\nLife as a Red Teamer is full of surprises and things do not always go according to plan. This means keeping a cool head even if everything is on fire. In this talk, two experienced Red Teamers share stories from the trenches \u2013 about misunderstandings, double agents, the thrill of getting caught as well as other good and bad surprises.\n\n**2\\. Does security always have to be expensive? Security Quick Wins in the Microsoft Windows environment**\n*Vanessa Barnekow*\nMost companies are built upon Microsoft Windows environments. At the heart of these environments is the Active Directory \u2013 which is therefore also an attractive target for attackers. When it comes to security, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often hesitate to take further steps \u2013 because they (wrongfully) assume that they are not be an interesting target and that security measures would cost them a fortune. This talk will present affordable and easily implementable measures that help harden Windows environments.\n\n_Afterwards? We will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility of **socializing** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **NVISO**.\n\n_When?\nOur Meetup takes place on the last Wednesday before the summer break in July, namely on 19.07.2023 from 18:00 to 21.00 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nNVISO GmbH, Holzgraben 5, 60313 Frankfurt\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nGet in touch with the Frankfurt Chapter Leads (Dan Gora or Jonas Becker)\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word,** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"

A new and unique security condition has emerged that has no IOC\u2019s or TTP\u2019s. However, it is arguably the most dangerous of all emerging threats. If exploited, it can alter elections, destabilize governments, and bring a swift end to truth and the institutions that rely on truth. The future of information security is detecting and preventing the spread of \u201cdisinformation\u201d.\n\nPart 1 of this series focused on the origins of \u201cactive measures\u201d in the Cold War and the events leading up to January 6th 2021. Part 2 of this series, will focus on a new framework to map disinformation tactics and techniques, and the impact AI based chatbots and \u201cdeepfake\u201d technology will have on the future of democracy.\n\nWithout trust, democracy has no future. Can the security community help to restore trust in information and save democracy for posterity?\n\n**Bio:**\nBrandon has over 12 years of IT/InfoSec experience working as a server admin, network engineer, and security engineer. Brandon currently serves as Senior Threat Detection Engineer for BlackBerry Cybersecurity unit. Brandon is also a visiting fellow at *The National Security Institute (NSI) at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School.* Brandon received his B.A. in Business Economics from the University of California, Irvine. Outside of InfoSec, Brandon is an avid hunter, backpacker, and \u201cbeach bum\u201d.\n\n**Speaker 2:** Lori Barfield, ShellCon RaiseMe / US Coast Guard Auxiliary\n**Topic 2:** How Volunteer Work Can Work for You\n\n**Abstract:**\nThere\u2019s a crushing Catch-22 in the technology world that keeps people from realizing their career dreams. Career consultants often hear this exasperated plea for help: \u201cHow do I get experience doing something new, when the companies I am talking to only want to hire people who already have experience?\u201d Lori is a former computer engineer and technology executive who will explain how candidates can gain key engineering work experience by volunteering. Volunteers participate in a very wide range of opportunities: from meetups to open source projects to service to the country. This talk will explain how to leverage a volunteer accomplishment with strategic integration into resumes and job interviews.\n\n**Bio:**\nLori Barfield joined her first Internet startup during the original .com boom as a Senior System Administrator, at a company that eventually went public. After moving into leadership there, she started an international executive consulting practice.\nLori\u2019s volunteer career began as a Chair for the Southern California Linux Expo. She has been a conference organizer and speaker in the Open Source world for 15 years. She also co-founded the cyber security conference ShellCon in 2017, and RaiseMe IT along with that. Through RaiseMe she has spoken and taught about career development at dozens of technical events across the country. Five years ago, Lori answered the call to duty and joined the Coast Guard Auxiliary. She is a Division Vice Commander and serves on the National Cybersecurity Penetration Testing team.\n\n**Schedule:**\n6:00pm - 6:30pm Networking, Food & Drink\n6:30pm - 7:30pm First Presentation\n7:30pm - 8:15pm Second Presentation\n\n### **Code of Conduct**\n\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

Then I will discuss how you can add security into these in a way that respects your development/SRE teams. Allowing teams to manage and configure their tools independently and in a distributed manner, while still having centralized visibility (through logs and metrics extracted from their pipelines, with associated dashboards and SLA/O/Is) and the ability to quickly deploy new IaC-specific security policies. We will also discuss a reasonable onramp \u2013 ensuring that teams don't need to triage piles of findings only to discover that most of them are false positives or low-priority noise. This will include a discussion of a real world roll-out, and a method that was developed to add passive security scans into existing IaC pipelines with no changes other than running the existing commands (terraform, ansible, etc.) inside of a new docker container."

Not surprisingly, Web APIs contribute more than 80% of the Internet traffic today. Given the importance of APIs, OWASP has recommended top-10 API specific security vulnerabilities (such as Broken Authentication/Authorization and Excessive Data Exposure problems) that organizations must address to strengthen their security posture. Albeit useful, these API specific vulnerabilities do not necessarily translate to the same business risks. For instance, two APIs from an organization with Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) may pose very different business risks to that organization.\n\nIn this session, we'll talk about API Risk Rating System (ARRS) that maps API specific vulnerabilities to business risks such as Legal/Contractual, Operational, Financial, Reputational and Regulatory. Similar in-principle yet different than Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), the main objective of ARRS is to prioritize API specific vulnerabilities based on their business risks. We'll describe the methodology behind the system developed using thousands of APIs that are being tracked at a global scale. We\u2019ll also share some hands-on practical scenarios.\n\nThe work presented was done by Samantha Sanchez, Jun Hee Lee, Alberto Ciconi and Baljeet Malhotra. Samantha, Jun Hee and Alberto are MSc Cybersecurity students at NYIT. Baljeet is an Adjunct Professor at NYIT, UBC, UVic, UNBC, and CEO of TeejLab Inc.\n\n**Location TBD**"

This talk provides an in-depth exploration of recently identified security concerns, their implications, and their incorporation into the Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS). We will delve into the specifics of ten novel additions to the ASVS that were proposed and subsequently accepted.\n\nThe security vulnerabilities we will discuss include Zip Slip, arbitrary file read via malicious Symlink, flaws in escaping special characters in regular expressions, Type Juggling, Latex Injection, JNDI Injection, Prototype Pollution, and Cache Deception. Each of these vulnerabilities poses unique threats and requires distinct mitigation strategies.\n\nWe will shed light on each vulnerability, explore real-world implications, discuss best practices in addressing these security gaps, and detail how they have been integrated into the ASVS. This talk aims to arm developers, security professionals, and decision-makers with vital knowledge to enhance their application security, aligning it with the latest standards in the industry. Attendees will gain comprehensive insights that will enable them to fortify their applications, networks, and systems against these cutting-edge security challenges.\n\n**Iman Sharafaldin**\nPassionate about all things code, Iman has more than 8 years of cybersecurity and software related experience.

We are delighted to host the next in-person event in Frankfurt! For this event, we will have a range of interesting talks delivered by leaders within AppSec & Cyber Security. There will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event at the venue.\n\n_What's going to happen?\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our OWASP Frankfurt Meetup hosted by **NVISO.**\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n**1\\. This Is Fine \u2013 Red Team Edition**\n*Firat Acar & Moritz Thomas*\nLife as a Red Teamer is full of surprises and things do not always go according to plan. This means keeping a cool head even if everything is on fire. In this talk, two experienced Red Teamers share stories from the trenches \u2013 about misunderstandings, double agents, the thrill of getting caught as well as other good and bad surprises.\n\n**2\\. Does security always have to be expensive? Security Quick Wins in the Microsoft Windows environment**\n*Vanessa Barnekow*\nMost companies are built upon Microsoft Windows environments. At the heart of these environments is the Active Directory \u2013 which is therefore also an attractive target for attackers. When it comes to security, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often hesitate to take further steps \u2013 because they (wrongfully) assume that they are not be an interesting target and that security measures would cost them a fortune. This talk will present affordable and easily implementable measures that help harden Windows environments.\n\n_Afterwards? We will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility of **socializing** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **NVISO**.\n\n_When?\nOur Meetup takes place on the last Wednesday before the summer break in July, namely on 19.07.2023 from 18:00 to 21.00 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nNVISO GmbH, Holzgraben 5, 60313 Frankfurt\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nGet in touch with the Frankfurt Chapter Leads (Dan Gora or Jonas Becker)\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word,** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"
