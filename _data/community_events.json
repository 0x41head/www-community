We're going on a journey on what is possible and what will be possible when combining AI with cybersecurity.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;Joona Hoikkala - Red Team Manager @Visma</p> <p>Working as red team manager at Visma, Joona is a hacker that has experience from multiple vantage points and aspects of information security, software development and brewing. He's an open so(u)rcerer and has built or contributed to a wide variety of security tools, both offensive and defensive. This talk is discussing both positive and negative phenomenom around a web fuzzing tool he built and maintains: ffuf, or: \"fuzz faster u fool\".</p> <p>~*FFUF - Fuzz Faster, U're ***ed ... The good, the bad and the ugly of web fuzzing~<br/>Abstract: Web fuzzing is a powerful method for automating the boring tasks in both black box, and gray box testing of web applications. There's only so much one can do when approaching this kind of target manually but with proper tooling the server resources are the only limit. Wait? Server resources being the limit?</p> <p>Penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, security researchers and criminals are using the same techniques for different purposes. What happens when you are able to send tens of thousands of requests from your laptop, over the internet to a target. What if you scale it up horizontally, doing the same thing from hundreds of sources? What if the responding endpoint is intentionally slow - a login for example?</p> <p>At the cloud-native age, rate limiting might seem as an ancient thing from a distant past but for the very same reasons it's more relevant than ever...</p> "

Aside from offensive security practices, Ignatius has also led numerous cyber maturity assessment engagements, architecture review, and is currently an instructor at Seneca College.</p> <p>TALK<br/>-------</p> <p>Software Composition Analysis 101: Knowing what\u2019s inside your apps</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>The term Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is relatively new to the security world. However, similar approaches have been used since the early 2000s to indicate security verifications on open source components. SCA has become an evolution of that. It is the process of identifying and listing all the components and versions present in the code and checking each specific service and looking for outdated or vulnerable libraries that may impose security risks to the application. These tools can also check for legal issues regarding the use of open-source software with different licensing terms and conditions. Nevertheless, how those SCA tools work, and how can they help identify and remediate issues on open source libraries used in a codebase? This talk aims to focus on and explain to the audience by showing how these tools work and the main pieces of information that these tools rely on, such as the application manifest, vulnerability data sources, and dependency metadata.</p> <p>Audience Takeaways<br/>SCA tools and techniques are here to stay, and their usage is increasing in many organizations where security is a priority. Unfortunately, AppSec teams cannot keep up with all the new vulnerabilities published daily. Make sure to look for solutions that can adequately adapt to your own way of building software. They need to cover the programming languages used in your organization and identify issues on indirect dependencies, not just relying on public CVEs to find those issues.</p> <p>Presenter:</p> <p>Magno Logan works as an Information Security Specialist for Trend Micro. He specializes in Cloud, Container and Application Security Research, Threat Modelling and Red Teaming. He has been tapped as a resource speaker for numerous security conferences around the globe. He is also a member of the CNCF SIG-Security team</p> "

Many of you already know of him, he is a legend in the Application Security industry.</p> <p>The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for web developers and web application security professionals. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. Companies should adopt this document and start the process of ensuring that their web applications minimize these risks. Using the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps the most effective first step towards changing the software development culture within your organization into one that produces more secure code.</p> <p>The OWASP Top Ten 2021 includes:<br/>- A01:2021-Broken Access Control<br/>- A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures<br/>- A03:2021-Injection<br/>- A04:2021-Insecure Design<br/>- A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration<br/>- A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components<br/>- A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures<br/>- A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures<br/>- A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failure<br/>- A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Jim Manico is the founder of Manicode Security where he trains software developers on secure coding and security engineering. He is also an investor/advisor for Nucleus Security, BitDiscovery, Secure Circle, KSOC and Inspectiv. Jim is a frequent speaker on secure software practices, is a member of the Java Champion community, and is the author of \"Iron-Clad Java: Building Secure Web Applications\" from Oracle Press. Jim also volunteers for the OWASP foundation as the project lead for the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard and the OWASP Cheatsheet Series. For more information, see <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmanico\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmanico</a></p> <p>We should also note that Jim graciously was one of the keynotes for our very own Application Security Pacific Northwest conference this year. We want to thank him for all of his contributions to the application security space and to our OWASP Vancouver community.</p> <p>_____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>Open discussion on OWASP Top 10 2021 Release (7:00-8:00pm)</p> <p>For the second hour, we will have an open conversation on the OWASP Top 10 for 2021.</p> <p>--&gt; What surprised you about the new Top 10?<br/>--&gt; What are you happy about?<br/>--&gt; How will this impact your Application Security program?<br/>--&gt; Is there something you thing can be done better?</p> <p>Make sure to stick around for the social hour, you do not want to miss this epic event!</p> "
