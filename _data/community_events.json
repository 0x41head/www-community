What continues to surprise him is the misconceptions that surface again and again about which teams should use these technologies and where they can benefit from them. David will debunk some of those myths and give us all a clearer picture on their usefulness and how and where we should be using them.\"\n\n7.00pm - Break\n7.15pm - TALK #2 \"DevSecOps with GitLab: How to embed Security within the Software Delivery Process\" with Stefania Chaplin\n\n\"Implementing DevOps can drastically improve the rate we deliver software. Organisations can go from deploying changes a few times a year to multiple times a day. What about vulnerabilities? Security is often considered an afterthought and this can have dire consequences as the world becomes increasingly reliant on software. How do we embed security into the software delivery process? Security is a quality check, there are multiple types and we need to make the software delivery experience as smooth as possible.In this session, you'll find out more about common pain points, solutions, and how to embed security within the software delivery process and secure your DevOps process.\"\n\n7.45pm - Questions/Any Other Business\n8.00pm - Close\n\n***\n\nNathan + Jim"

There will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event at the venue.\n\n_What's going to happen?\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our OWASP Frankfurt Meetup hosted by **CHECK24 Frankfurt.**\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n* _Talk 1 - \"**AI-Enhanced Application Security: A Modern Approach**\" by **Diana Waithanji**, Cybersecurity engineer at SAP.\nThis talk will discuss how AI is being used to solve application security issues. We will explore the potential benefits of using AI in this area, such as increased efficiency and effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Additionally, we will discuss some of the challenges and limitations that come with using AI in application security and how they can be addressed.\n* _Talk 2 - \"**Beyond the Checkbox: Breaking out of Testing Frameworks**\" by **Jiska Classen**, As mobile applications handle sensitive data, ensuring their security is crucial. However, simply securing individual apps is not enough to stop real-world attackers who exploit devices through other avenues. This talk will explore unconventional security testing approaches that can help improve app security by addressing vulnerabilities in the operating system, hardware, and third-party libraries. Discover how attackers can exploit wireless interfaces, sandboxing, privilege checking bypasses, and more. Let's explore why these attack vectors are relevant in practice and how to address them beyond standard security testing checklists.\n\n_Afterwards? We will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility to **socialize** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **CHECK24 Frankfurt**.\n\n_When\nOur Meetup takes place on the last Wednesday of the month in April, namely on 26.04.2023 from 18:00 to 21.00 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nCHECK24 Frankfurt is located at Speicherstra\u00dfe 55 in Frankfurt am Main, ca. 15min within walking distance of Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nGet in touch with the Frankfurt Chapter Leads (Dan Gora or Jonas Becker)\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"

We're going to dive into the marvelous world of \"artificial intelligence\" and \"prompt engineering\".\nThis session will cover two CTF challenges based on Stable Diffusion which is a model capable of generating photo-realistic images given any text input. This will allow us to show in a practical fashion some potential real impact of something otherwise artificial.\nParticipants can bring their laptop to try the challenges by themselves. If you have a gaming laptop with a dedicated graphic card, that could be handy!

There will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event at the venue.\n\n_What's going to happen?\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our OWASP Frankfurt Meetup hosted by **CHECK24 Frankfurt.**\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n* _Talk 1 - \"**AI-Enhanced Application Security: A Modern Approach**\" by **Diana Waithanji**, Cybersecurity engineer at SAP.\nThis talk will discuss how AI is being used to solve application security issues. We will explore the potential benefits of using AI in this area, such as increased efficiency and effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Additionally, we will discuss some of the challenges and limitations that come with using AI in application security and how they can be addressed.\n* _Talk 2 - \"**Beyond the Checkbox: Breaking out of Testing Frameworks**\" by **Jiska Classen**, As mobile applications handle sensitive data, ensuring their security is crucial. However, simply securing individual apps is not enough to stop real-world attackers who exploit devices through other avenues. This talk will explore unconventional security testing approaches that can help improve app security by addressing vulnerabilities in the operating system, hardware, and third-party libraries. Discover how attackers can exploit wireless interfaces, sandboxing, privilege checking bypasses, and more. Let's explore why these attack vectors are relevant in practice and how to address them beyond standard security testing checklists.\n\n_Afterwards? We will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility to **socialize** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **CHECK24 Frankfurt**.\n\n_When\nOur Meetup takes place on the last Wednesday of the month in April, namely on 26.04.2023 from 18:00 to 21.00 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nCHECK24 Frankfurt is located at Speicherstra\u00dfe 55 in Frankfurt am Main, ca. 15min within walking distance of Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nGet in touch with the Frankfurt Chapter Leads (Dan Gora or Jonas Becker)\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"
