How do I \"do\" it?\nThere's a lot of hype around DevSecOps right now, and getting two people to agree on exactly what it means can be challenging. Unfortunately, a lot of vendor narrative says it's CI/CD with some security thrown in for good measure, but DevSecOps is a lot more than that!\n\nMy career was changed by the DevOps movement, and I believe that DevSecOps should be built on top of DevOps. What does that mean? Well, what made DevOps so powerful for me in the late 2000s was that it brought together people from different departments to work together. Developers learned more about how to manage the underlying infrastructure, and ops teams learned how to use code to build and manage automation. This was powerful, and I believe we can do the same with DevSecOps: bring security teams into the processes and workflows that DevOps built. At the same time, those security teams will evolve to understand how operations and development teams work.\n\nThis talk will cover my DevSecOps Playbook, which is a step-by-step open-source guide to implementing DevSecOps for any organisation.\nThis Playbook is broken down into 5 distinct areas of domain expertise:\n\n1\\. Development Environment\n2\\. Source Code Management\n3\\. Continuous Integration / Deployment and other Automation\n4\\. Deployment Environments\n5\\. Organisational Functions\n\nThe DevSecOps Playbooks spreads the controls evenly across these 5 domains and highlights that this is a group responsibility. There is also an addendum for compliance frameworks and how they can map to the tasks and controls listed in the Playbook.\n\nIn this talk, I will outline these 5 areas and talk about the different controls and tasks in each. I will also give examples of how to implement a subset of these controls."

        "description": "Hosted by the Cyber Security & Networking Research Group, Anglia Ruskin University, OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Cambridge Chapter, & BCS Cybercrime Forensics SG\n\n**Background**\n\nThe BCS \u2013 Chartered Institute for IT - Cybercrime Forensics Special Interest Group (SG) promotes Cybercrime Forensics and the use of Cybercrime Forensics; of relevance to computing professionals, lawyers, law enforcement officers, academics and those interested in the use of Cybercrime Forensics and the need to address cybercrime for the benefit of those groups and of the wider public.\n\nOWASP (Open Web Application Security Project is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of application software. Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.\n\nThe **Cyber Security and Networking** (**CSN**) Research Group at Anglia Ruskin University has close working strategic relationships with industry, professional bodies, law enforcement, government agencies and academia in the delivery of operationally focused applied information and application security research. We have strong international links with professional organisations such as OWASP, BCS, ISC2, IISP & the UK Cyber Security Forum amongst others. The primary aims of CSNRG are to help the UK and partner nations to tackle cybercrime, be more resilient to cyber attacks and educate its users for a more secure cyberspace and operational business environment. These will be achieved through the investigation of threats posed to information systems and understanding the impact of attacks and creation of cyber-based warning systems which gathering threat intelligence, automate threat detection, alert users and neutralising attacks. For network security we are researching securing the next generation of software defined infrastructures from the application API and control/data plane attacks. Other key work includes Computer forensic analysis, digital evidence crime scenes and evidence visualisation as well as Cyber educational approaches such as developing Capture the Flag (CTF) resources and application security programs.\n\n**Abstract : \u201cHow reliable are current forensic processes in combatting the illegal use of portable programmable devices?**\n\nThe teaching of digital forensics must be restricted, by its very nature, as we can\u2019t teach students everything. There is a new threat to best practice that we have encountered in our research, which could lead to a miscarriage of justice, where an innocent person is falsely accused of a crime. In our research, we have found that hardware devices, such as the Rubber Ducky, Bash Bunny and the O.MG cable can be used to commit or facilitate a crime. These devices leave very little forensics evidence on the target device, other than showing that a file was accessed or that an illegal picture was downloaded and viewed.\n\nThe user of the victim machine could easily be wrongly accused of a crime that they know nothing about, and they will not easily be able to prove their innocence. Forensics investigators might look no further than the access times of the file that was altered or the picture that was downloaded and viewed and would not even look for clues that might point to a hardware attack. This paper highlights the difficulties of proving that a hardware attack even took place and shows the lack of awareness amongst digital forensics investigators to this possibility.\n\n**Provisional Agenda**\n\n17:15 - Webinar waiting lobby opens\n17:30 - Start of Presentation\n18:20 \u2013 Questions & Answers\n18:30 \u2013 Estimated Finish"

In this event we hope to cement that knowledge by showing you the view from the other side of the fence.\nIn this live interactive demonstration we will show you what a web target looks like from the perspective of an attacker. With the use of a vulnerable target that has not followed security best practices we will show you just how easy it is for an attacker to gain access to your computer, it's data and resources. With each step of the attack we will demonstrate techniques and tools while discussing what could of been done to mitigate each step of the attack.\nBy thinking like a Hacker and seeing your \"defences\" from their point of view we hope to show you how important following cyber security best practices really is.\nAttendees of the OWASP Suffolk Fight Club events will be familiar with the format of this event, except that this will be scripted with interactive Q&A. The vulnerable target will be a virtual machine created for the purpose of learning.\nAgenda:\n\n* OWASP updates\n* Live interactive demonstration of a web attack with Q&A throughout\n\nDisclaimer: As always our events are designed to educate.

Further details can be found below.\n\nThere will be refreshments available on the night.\n\n**Speaker One:** Gavin O'Gorman - Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) & The war in Ukraine\n\nGavin is a principal intelligence analyst in the Signals team, a part of Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC). His current role is to work with intelligence analysts in MSTIC, and engineers on the Signals team, to help build systems and automation that enable analysts to track more malicious actors, faster. Prior to working in Microsoft, Gavin spent 13 years in Symantec, working as a reverse engineer, incident handler, intelligence analyst and manager of the Attack Investigations Team. He has tracked and authored reports on actors operating across the world, including both government and corporate espionage, and e-crime. Gavin also lectures the Advanced Malware course in UCD's MSc in Forensic Computing and Cybercrime.\"\n\n**Topic: MSTIC & The war in Ukraine**\n\nPrior to and during the war in Ukraine, MSTIC tracked multiple Russian actors engaging in offensive cyber operations against Ukraine. MSTIC has attributed these actors back to Russian entities such as the SVR, GRU and FSB.\nIn this talk, we'll review the types of attacks that MSTIC identified being performed against Ukraine. How does one identify the right person to prevent a cyber attack against an organisation physically located in an active warzone? We'll show how Microsoft worked with Ukrainian individuals and organisations to help mitigate attacks, including techniques that Microsoft would apply for the first time.\n\n**Speaker Two:** Oliver Ciappara- Automating Malware Analysis\n\nOliver is a Senior Malware Analysis Developer at Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC). Oliver's primary focus is to automate and streamline file analysis within Microsoft.\n\nThe tools that Oliver is putting in place enable rapid analysis and triage of malware. This rapid analysis allows threat intelligence teams to track actor activity by extracting relevant indicators and context, as well as help protect Microsoft's customers.\n\nBefore joining Microsoft, Oliver developed software for embedded systems as well as cybersecurity products. Having recently completed a Master's in Law from UCC, specialising in Cybercrime and E-Law, he has a unique combination of technical and legal expertise.\"\n\n**Topic: Automating Malware Analysis**\n\nDiscover the power of Automated Malware Analysis with Assemblyline. Developed by the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, Assemblyline is a cutting-edge open-source solution for automating malware analysis. With its modular and scalable architecture, Assemblyline efficiently processes and aggregates information from various analysers, while also centralizing analysis tools used by different teams. Automated malware analysis lowers the bar and enables TIs to continue their work as quickly as possible, while also freeing up REs to do the more important work. Join us and get a first-hand look at assemblyline and its capabilities.\n\n**Thank you to our speakers for the evening and also to Workday for hosting us. Without the support of the community we would not be able to run these meetups.**"

API security poses unique challenges to builders and defenders, and many of your existing detection and protection measures may prove to be ineffective.\n\nJoin Colin as he draws on his experience from curating the industry's biggest API security resource (APISecurity.io) in exploring the following:\nCrash course on the OWASP API Security Top 10 (and how it differs from the OWASP Top 10)\nA whistle-stop tour of some of the biggest API breaches over the past 18 months, taking a look at what went wrong, the impact, and most importantly, how to prevent such attacks.\nFinally, he will present the top techniques for protecting your APIs from attack, starting with secure development practices through to API protection and threat detection.\n\nThe content will be technical, with demos and code samples, and based on real-world breaches. By the end of the session, you will have an understanding of the API Security Top 10, and have a working knowledge of how to protect your APIs, either at a code level or using runtime protections.\n*Bio:*\nColin has a long and varied career in producing secure, rugged, and trustable software and hardware products covering a range of industries from military, consumer, medical, automotive to financial services. In the last decade, he has become a sought-after evangelist and consultant in building AppSec programs, and the latest developments in DevSecOps. His greatest passion is for teaching and inspiring others to produce software we can trust, either delivering webinars, in-person events or speaking to the C-level.\n\nCurrently, he is the Chief Technology Evangelist with 42Crunch, the curator of the APISecurity.io newsletter, and is writing the industry\u2019s first book on defending APIs.\n\n**Managing APIs securely**\n*Abstract:*\nWhen an organization offers an API, the API needs to become a Managed API. This means that lifecycle management, security, and throttling resources become an important aspect of API Management, as well as the ability of developers to find, explore and subscribe to the API to use them.\n\nDuring the presentation, Rob will zoom into these aspects and how an API Manager can help you with security and throttling (including schema validation and advanced scenarios) while at the same time making the API easily available to your target developers (inside or outside the organization).\n\nIn the second part, he will elaborate on the \u201cshiny frontend / dirty backend\u201d. This is an API frontend that accesses legacy systems, databases, but also the integration of a set of APIs etc., thus enabling services that use older technology or proprietary interfaces to have a modern appearance to the outside world, e.g. exposing a legacy insurance policy administration system as an API.\n\nThirdly, we will look at the way you can implement the Mastodon API. Since Elon Musk acquired Twitter l ast year, alternative platforms like Mastodon have become more popular. It might be that this becomes a viable channel to communicate with clients for some organizations.\n*Bio:*\nRob has 30 years of experience in IT in such roles as developer, analyst, project manager, business consultant, and management consultant. He is currently Head of Training Services and Integration Consultant at Yenlo, responsible for the development and the actual training of Yenlo\u2019s clients and consultants.\n\nNext to these responsibilities, Rob is also an avid blogger with almost 200 blogs on innovation on Frankwatching, more than 150 blogs on WSO2 on Yenlo\u2019s website and many other blogs on various other sites. Rob is also a regular contributor to BNR Zaken Doen radio show on the area of technology and innovation.\n\n**Delegates may be asked to provide a valid proof of photo ID (such as a driving licence or passport) to enter the venue.**"

        "description": "OWASP SB and GitHub have joined forces to bring you the first security meetup of the year in beautiful Santa Barbara. Come join the local AppSec/InfoSec community for a great evening of technical talks and mindful networking. Dinner will be provided.\n\n**Event Agenda**\n05.30pm -- Event kickoff, with dinner and networking.\n06.00pm -- Announcements, by W. Mart\u00edn Villalba (OWASP SB).\n06.15pm -- Intro to GitHub Advanced Security, by Levy Forchheimer (GitHub).\n06.30pm -- Proactive vs. Reactive AppSec, by Ravi Gadhia (GitHub).\n07.30pm -- BYOT / Networking.\n08.30pm -- Event end.\n\n**Proactive vs. Reactive AppSec - Abstract**\nMost security findings are discovered after the code has been committed to your main branch. Meaning they will be part of your security tech debt that often takes months to fix. In this talk, learn how you can shift your security approach from reactive to proactive and prevent security weaknesses from ever making it into your code.\n\n**Ravi Gadhia - Bio**\nRavi Gadhia is a technologist who began his career as a chip designer and found his way to customer-facing roles in the software industry. His primary areas of expertise are in software development, collaboration tools, and cloud native platforms. Ravi is currently Director of a Solutions Engineering at GitHub where he leads a technical sales team in the Western US.\n\n**Levy Forchheimer - Bio**\nLevy Forchheimer is an Enterprise Account Executive at GitHub. He's been in AppSec for nearly a decade and his expertise spans DevOps, SCA and Secret Management.\n\n**BYOT: Bring Your Own Topic**\nThis meeting is a great chance to ask for technical help, career advice, share new ideas, look for feedback, and discuss anything related to AppSec/InfoSec.\n\n**Location**\nKiva Cowork - Funk Zone, 10 E Yanonali St, Santa Barbara, CA. The front door will be kept open for the duration of the event. If you have any trouble getting in, please do not leave, just knock on the front/side doors and/or message us through this platform.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you all!\n\nMart\u00edn\nOWASP SB Leader"

The threats realized in the form of Distributed Denial-of-service attacks, a type of attack aiming at disrupting normal operations and availability of online services and websites. As a result, several Swedish websites were affected, but thankfully not nation-critical services.\n\nDDoS attacks are on the rise on a global scale. They are used by organized crime to blackmail organizations, as well as nation state actors to attack infrastructure of other countries, often opportunistically under the cover of political events.\n\nFor this event we get together to discuss what happened, but more importantly what we can do to protect the organizations we work for against DDoS attacks.\n\nThe event will be held using huddle in Slack so make sure to join the channel \u201cchapter-stockholm\u201d."

We discussed creating strong passwords, patching and backing up, OSINT, API Security, SCA and RASP, and many other subjects. In this event we hope to cement that knowledge by showing you the view from the other side of the fence.\n\nIn this live interactive demonstration we will show you what a web target looks like from the perspective of an attacker. With the use of a vulnerable target that has not followed security best practices we will show you just how easy it is for an attacker to gain access to your computer, it's data and resources. With each step of the attack we will demonstrate techniques and tools while discussing what could of been done to mitigate each step of the attack.\n\nBy thinking like a Hacker and seeing your \"defences\" from their point of view we hope to show you how important following cyber security best practices really is.\n\nAttendees of the OWASP Suffolk Fight Club events will be familiar with the format of this event, except that this will be scripted with interactive Q&A. The vulnerable target will be a virtual machine created for the purpose of learning.\n\nAgenda:\n\n* OWASP updates\n* Live interactive demonstration of a web attack with Q&A throughout\n\nDisclaimer: As always our events are designed to educate. Any tools and techniques demonstrated are for informative purposes only. We do not endorse their use for malicious purposes.\n\nThis talk will not be recorded."

The ideal established flow says that if we changed even a single character in our JWT, the request should not pass through, which it doesn't. But it passes through if the change is done at a specific position in the token.\n\nConceptually it appears to be a valid test case because it's a tampering of the token. But the catch is it's not valid test case, and this talk is about that why this is not a valid test case.\n\n**Where:** https://us06web.zoom.us/j/87352968700?pwd=YmE0cWdhQWNxNmo4cEZrbHpidmlhdz09"
