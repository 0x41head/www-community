Along with informative talks around AppSec, there will also be some awesome food & drinks, as well as access to an outdoor patio for network throughout the event.\n\nBrief agenda below:\n5:00 \u2013 6:00: Networking/Food\n6:00 \u2013 6:25: What is Application Security Posture Management (ASPM)?\n6:30 \u2013 6:55: Coverage - The Missing Link of WebApp/API Security Testing\n6:55 \u2013 7:10 : Short Break\n7:10 \u2013 7:35: TBD\n7:35 \u2013 8:00: Networking\n\n**What is Application Security Posture Management (ASPM)?**\nCompanies adopt many application security testing (AST) tools to pinpoint critical software issues and keep compliant with OWASP standards. Yet despite this AppSec investment, they still fail to get an accurate view of risk, and struggle integrate testing, triage, and remediation within developer workflows. This has driven the evolution of application security posture management (ASPM).\nIn this session, we\u2019ll dive into:\n\\- What is ASPM\\, and capabilities that a comprehensive solution should have\n\\- Best practices on using ASPM to accelerate AppSec transformation and consolidate data\\, workflows\\, and visibility\n\\- How ASPM is central to helping your teams keep up with OWASP compliance and mitigate software risk at scale\\.\n\n**Speaker:-** Natasha is a Senior Product Marketing Manager at Synopsys, driving go-to-market strategy for Software Risk Manager, an ASPM solution. She has worked for ten years in the cybersecurity and enterprise networking space. Prior to Synopsys, Natasha was with ServiceNow, where she managed product marketing initiatives for ServiceNow Security Operations, a SOAR platform for incident and vulnerability management. She has also held roles in product marketing and software product management at Imperva and A10 Networks.\nTalk#2: **Coverage - The Missing Link of WebApp/API Security Testing**\nMost DAST tools will boast about how many hundreds of thousands of attacks/checkers/vulns they scan for. But most still have a hard time automatically finding all of the pages/endpoints/actions in modern applications (e.g. SPAs) and APIs. Not to mention figuring out how to test everything they find in both a meaningful way and a reasonable amount of time. After all these years and entire markets built on web scraping, why is crawling for security testing still so hard? Why isn't an OpenAPI/Swagger spec enough to properly test an API? And what are we doing about it? In this session we'll dive in to those missing links and explore how we can actually feel confident in our automated testing coverage.\n\n**Speaker2**: Steve Chappell, SW Manager & API Security Evangelist\nSteve has done a little bit of everything in his 10 years at Synopsys (R&D, Sales, and yes, he even got suckered into Marketing for a while), but currently loves his role as a SW Engineering Manager, leading a team developing novel dynamic testing engines targeting webapps and APIs. When he's not evangelizing Application/API security, you might find him playing or creating word/puzzle games at the top of a multi-pitch climb drinking a craft or Belgian beer... or coaching youth sports.\n\n**Talk3#** TBD"

Please note that all our events are live-streamed on YouTube for the online audience. Recordings will be available on the OWASP London YouTube channel.**\n\n**Venue Location**: JustEat, Fleet Place House, 2 Fleet Pl, London, EC4M 7RF (note: the entrance is directly opposite Starbucks front doors)\n**Nearest Tube Station:** St. Pauls (Central Line) - 6 mins walk\n**Doors Open at 6pm** for registration, food, drinks and networking. The talks start at **6:30pm** (we start on time).\n\n**TALKS**\n\n**OWASP Introduction, Welcome and News** \\- Sam Stepanyan\\, Sherif Mansour and Andra Lezza\nWelcome and a brief update on OWASP Projects & upcoming OWASP Conferences from the OWASP London Chapter Leaders\n\n**\"A Data-Led Approach to Cybersecurity\"** \\- Disha Mukherjee\nCome along on a journey as we explore the transformative power of big data in the realm of cybersecurity. We'll dive into the data deluge, the might of data analytics in sniffing out threats, and the crucial role of real-time monitoring. Learn how a data-focused approach to security can revolutionize your defenses, from harnessing advanced analytics to envisioning the future of AI in cybersecurity. Get set to unlock the potential of big data in strengthening your systems and reducing risks. Together, let's boost security with data and chart a path towards enhanced protection against ever-evolving cyber threats.\n\n**\"How To Write Insecure Code and Other Stories\"** \\- Shruti Kulkarni\nWe live in a \"speed-to-market\" era. Including security controls in applications sometimes may be considered an overhead. However, if security controls are not added to applications during development, it may be challenging to add them later on. In this presentation, we will see how code can be written insecurely and really how simple it is to include the required security controls in the application.\n\n\"**DevSecOps Worst Practices**\" - Tanya Janca\nQuite often when we read best practices we are told \u2018what\u2019 to do, but not the \u2018why\u2019. When we are told to ensure there are no false positives in the pipeline, the reason seems obvious, but not every part of DevOps is that intuitive, and not all \u2018best practices\u2019 make sense on first blush. Let\u2019s explore tried, tested, and failed methods, and then flip them on their head, so we know not only what to do to avoid them, but also why it is important to do so, with these DevSecOps WORST practices.\n\n**SPEAKERS**\n\n**Disha Mukherjee (**@[DishaMukherjee](https://github.com/DishaMukherjee/)**)**\nDisha is a Data Engineer on the Information Security Team at Just Eat Takeaway. Her job is all about designing, developing, and maintaining efficient data pipelines that help us make informed decisions about all things security-related.\n\n**Shruti Kulkarni ([@shruti-s-kulkarni](https://github.com/Shruti-s-kulkarni))**\nShruti is a cyber security / enterprise security architect with experience in ISO27001, PCI-DSS, policies, standards, security tools, threat modelling, risk assessments. Shruti works on security strategies and collaborates with cross-functional groups to implement information security controls in software development life-cycle, service operations, service delivery such that security controls support business requirements.\n\n**Tanya Janca ([@shehackspurple](https://twitter.com/shehackspurple))**\nTanya Janca, also known as SheHacksPurple, is the best-selling author of \u2018Alice and Bob Learn Application Security\u2019. She is also the founder of \"We Hack Purple\", an online learning community that revolves around teaching everyone to create secure software. Tanya has been coding and working in IT for over twenty five years, won countless awards, and has been everywhere from public service to tech giants, writing software, leading communities, founding companies and \u2018securing all the things\u2019. She is an award-winning public speaker, active blogger & podcaster and has delivered hundreds of talks on 6 continents. Tanya values diversity, inclusion, and kindness, which shines through in her countless initiatives.

Villegas**, President and Founder of iSecurePrivacy, LLC.\n\n**ABSTRACT**: In today's digital landscape, the protection of user privacy has become a paramount concern. As web developers, it is our responsibility to ensure that the websites and applications we create not only deliver exceptional user experiences but also prioritize the privacy and security of user data. This lecture, \"Privacy by Design for Web Developers,\" explores the foundational principles and practical strategies that empower web developers to integrate privacy into every facet of their work.\nIn this lecture, we will delve into the concept of Privacy by Design (PbD) and its significance in the context of web development. We will examine how PbD serves as a proactive approach to safeguarding user data, fostering trust, and complying with evolving privacy regulations such as the GDPR and CCPA/CPRA.\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available**\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

Learn From Others in the DevOps and DevSecOps Communities\nLook to the DevOps community to help close your critical knowledge gaps.\n2. 2\\. Start With Your Container Security\nThe first step to building out the security of your DevOps toolchain starts with your container security.\n3. Institute Continuous Compliance\nDevSecOps is a platform for continuous compliance to protect your software supply chains against vulnerable packages and vulnerable configurations.\n4. Double Down on Automation\nWhile you may have already been experimenting with automation during your DevOps phase, it only becomes more integral once you throw the switch in by going DevSecOps. Go into your DevOps to DevSecOps transformation with an automation strategy that focuses on automating common developer and sysadmin tasks.\n5. Improve Your Monitoring and Analytics\nBuilding out a DevSecOps toolchain takes your monitoring and analytics options to a new level. Consider the fact that you should already collect and publish data from your toolchain and deliver reports to your project managers, developers, QA testers, and stakeholders outside your team. Commonly, DevOps reporting is still a work in progress for organizations. Use the introduction of new security tools into your toolchain as a chance to offer more granular and real-time security reporting into all parts of your DevSecOps toolchain.\n6. Implement Accessibility Assurance\nDepending on your organization\u2019s definition of compliance, the option is there to add accessibility compliance or Section 508 to your DevSecOps toolchain.\n\nThis hands-on training is reserver for 70% professional and 30% students.\n\nMandatory:\n\nGeneral Conditions in order to validate your participation to this event:\n\n1\\. Student must send University/Student ID\\, otherwise registration will be rejected\\.\n\n2.Professional must register company emails, otherwise registration will be rejected.\n\nRegistration only via EventBrite. We don't accept answer via meetup.\n\nPlease indicate your firstname, lastname, company name, a valid business email or school email (email like gmai, free, hotmail, outlook, etc are not accepted and registration will be cancelled).\n\nPlease register here:\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/billets-devsecops-toolchain-transformation-374188276207"

We will share lots of hacker tips and tricks, and provide plenty of quiz moments to train your intuition. Our focus will be on vulnerabilities that hackers actually care about, rather than theoretical ones. All of our examples will be based on real-world exploit chains, and we will explore multiple vulnerabilities chained together to create media-news-headline-worthy outcomes. By the end of this talk, you will have a better understanding of how attackers think and operate, and you will be better equipped to defend against their attacks.\n\nOur January host and sponsor is Solutional Inc, and the talk will take place in their Portland office at 301 SE 2nd Ave.\n\nPlease RSVP here if you are planning to attend.\n\nThis is a monthly event of OWASP's Portland chapter."
