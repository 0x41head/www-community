While extensions can be very useful, they come with hidden dangers \u2013 users often prioritise functionality over safety. In this talk, you'll uncover the real risks of using extensions, explore common attacks, and learn about pitfalls. You'll also take a look at some real-life security incidents and what went wrong. You'll leave with a deeper understanding of the need for browser extension security and how to safeguard your browser.\n\n**Bio:** Billy Sheppard is a Bristol-based Senior Application Security Engineer working at Immersive Labs where he creates Secure Code content and challenges for their product.\n\nIn his career thus far, he has earned several achievements including VDP submissions for Fortune 500 companies, Bug bounties, and created and released his own niche CTF/Hacking challenge specifically aimed at increasing security awareness for ServiceNow developers. He has also created a Web Security YouTube Channel to demonstrate security concepts and educate developers and reported multiple real security issues to VDPs/Bug Bounty Programs for large companies such as BBC, RedHat and Accenture. He is a keen learner and spends a lot of his personal time continuously learning and is passionate about education around secure code.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nTalk 2: **An Introduction to scripting for Application Testers,** presented by **Alex Archondakis**.\n\n**Abstract**: Scripting, or the ability to write code that allows you to perform actions or automate repetitive tasks is a crucial tool in any application security testers belt, however, it doesn\u2019t seem to be a common one.\n\nThe purpose of this talk is to introduce scripting to application security testers, this will be achieved by looking at case studies to determine where scripting may be appropriate and how to solve the problem. We will discuss multiple languages and their advantages whilst focussing on interacting with the HTTP protocol.\n\nThe key learning points from this talk are as follows:\n\n* To gain an understanding of the importance of scripting for application security testers\n* What programming languages are used, and their advantages/disadvantages.\n* Typical scenarios where scripting is required because tooling is not comprehensive enough\n\n**Bio**: Alex is head of professional services & a senior consultant at Pentest People. He has a wealth of experience in penetration testing, people management and training hackers. He believes that all application security professionals should be able to write basic scripts to solve common problems."

We use it when checking our bank statements, buying pig plushies online, or sending stickers to each other on instant messengers. Given its ubiquity, it is, for the most part, taken for granted by developers: import HTTP/crypto/TLS, throw in a certificate from Let's Encrypt, and don't think much about it while relying on (hopefully) safe defaults.\nWhile sticking with well-vetted libraries should work out of the box for most cases, in certain areas, you need to be a bit more knowledgeable, if only to make good decisions about what libraries to use and how to wrangle all the moving parts into a cohesive and secure system.\nCryptography tends to be full of obscure notation that isn't that dissimilar to magic spells, and \"Don't Roll Your Own Crypto\" is an often repeated mantra (many times because of the previous statement). Search results for \"crypto\" have been getting progressively more complicated to navigate, with BTC, XRP, and others taking up all the prime SEO result space.\nThis talk targets a beginner to an intermediate audience and, starting from a brief overview of core tenets (Kerckhoffs's principle, Schneier's Law, the economy of mechanism, theoretical vs. practical security), will expand upon the current challenges and trends in modern cryptography, from FHE to PQC (including explaining what those are), and also highlight common design pitfalls (and their consequences) and how to reduce your snake oil intake.\n\nBio:\nAn opinionated individual with interest in cryptography and its intersection with secure software development.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xdsousa/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xdsousa/)"

These costs are the result of misconfiguration in infrastructure and workloads. One way to proactively identify misconfiguration is through security scanning. The scan results provide us with insights into the security posture of our services over time. However, these scanners treat our resources as static and evaluate misconfiguration only in single instances. To assess the potential impact of misconfiguration in our production environment, we need additional tools. In this talk, we will look at ways Chaos Engineering and Security Experimentation can help us minimise the potential damage of misconfiguration. Chaos Engineering is the process of intentionally introducing fault into a system to test its resilience to failure. Anais will walk you through the principles of Security Chaos Engineering and how it can be used to proactively identify misconfiguration and make our deployment pipeline and services more robust.\n\n**Talk 2: \"It\u2019s Not a Bug It\u2019s Emergent Behaviour - Generative AI, Its Cybersecurity Risks and Benefits\" - Sherif Mansour**\n\nA curated talk on generative AI, where Sherif will present his research findings beginning with an overview of the technology, then discuss its current technical risks, and explore its promising security use cases without making grand claims. Additionally, this talk dive into design considerations when developing web applications utilising generative AI. To conclude, Sherif will introduce open-source software announced during the talk, encouraging attendees to use and investigate them at their own discretion.\n\n**SPEAKERS:**\n\n**Ana\u00efs Urlichs (@urlichsanais)**\n\nAna\u00efs Urlichs is a Developer Advocate at Aqua Security, where she contributes to Aqua\u2019s cloud native open source projects. When she is not advocating DevOps best practices, she runs her own YouTube Channel centered around cloud native technologies. Before joining Aqua, Anais worked as SRE at Civo, a cloud native service provider, where she worked on infrastructure for hundreds of tenant clusters. As OpenUK ambassador, her passion lies in making tools and platforms more accessible to developers and community members.\n\n**Sherif Mansour (@kerberosmansour)**\n\nSherif Mansour is the global director of information security at JustEat Takeaway.com and has been working in the field of information security for 19 years. He was the OWASP chairman and sat on of the OWASP foundations' board for four years. He was also one of the founding governing board members for the OpenSSF Foundation which he represented the OWASP Foundation. Sherif contributed to several OWASP projects and was one the main authors of the CIS Benchmark for Tomcat 7/8.

        "description": "**[KHUSUS MAHASISWA ITTELKOM SURABAYA]**\n\nPentingnya Keamanan Siber bagi Mahasiswa di Era Serba Digital\n\nDi era digital yang semakin maju ini, mahasiswa menjadi salah satu kelompok yang paling rentan terhadap ancaman keamanan siber. Dalam kegiatan sehari-hari, mahasiswa sering menggunakan perangkat teknologi seperti laptop, smartphone, dan tablet untuk mengakses informasi, berkomunikasi, dan menjalankan tugas kuliah. Oleh karena itu, penting bagi mahasiswa untuk memahami betapa krusialnya menjaga keamanan siber. Dalam tulisan ini, akan dijelaskan secara persuasif mengapa keamanan siber menjadi hal yang sangat penting bagi mahasiswa.\nPertama-tama, mahasiswa sering kali memiliki akses ke berbagai macam data pribadi. Informasi seperti email, nomor telepon, alamat rumah, dan bahkan informasi keuangan dapat tersimpan dalam perangkat digital mereka. Jika keamanan siber tidak dijaga dengan baik, data pribadi tersebut bisa jatuh ke tangan yang salah dan digunakan untuk tujuan yang tidak bertanggung jawab. Identitas mahasiswa dapat dicuri, dan itu bisa berdampak buruk pada kehidupan mereka baik secara pribadi maupun akademik. Keamanan siber yang kuat akan melindungi privasi mahasiswa dan mencegah kerugian yang tidak diinginkan.\nSelanjutnya, keamanan siber yang baik juga penting untuk melindungi informasi akademik. Mahasiswa sering kali memiliki akses ke sistem informasi universitas, database perpustakaan, dan platform pembelajaran online. Melalui serangan siber, informasi ini dapat dicuri atau diubah oleh pihak yang tidak berwenang. Jika karya tulis, proyek penelitian, atau tugas kuliah mahasiswa dimanipulasi atau diakses oleh pihak lain, itu akan merusak reputasi akademik mereka. Dengan menjaga keamanan siber, mahasiswa dapat melindungi integritas karya akademik mereka dan memastikan bahwa prestasi mereka diakui dengan adil.\nSelain itu, keamanan siber juga berkaitan erat dengan keamanan finansial mahasiswa. Banyak mahasiswa yang menggunakan kartu kredit atau sistem pembayaran online untuk membayar biaya kuliah, membeli bahan bacaan, atau bahkan berbelanja secara online. Jika keamanan siber tidak dijaga dengan baik, informasi keuangan mereka dapat dicuri dan disalahgunakan oleh penjahat siber. Hal ini dapat menyebabkan kerugian finansial yang signifikan bagi mahasiswa, serta mempengaruhi kemampuan mereka untuk melanjutkan pendidikan mereka. Dengan memperhatikan keamanan siber, mahasiswa dapat melindungi diri mereka dari ancaman ini dan menjaga kestabilan finansial mereka.\nTerakhir, penting bagi mahasiswa untuk menyadari bahwa mereka bukan hanya individu yang terisolasi dalam lingkungan digital. Mahasiswa sering berkomunikasi dengan teman, dosen, dan rekan sejawat melalui email, media sosial, atau platform kolaborasi online. Jika keamanan siber mereka tercompromi, ini juga dapat membahayakan orang lain dalam jaringan mereka."

As the Head of Cybersecurity Services, Octavian brings within Global Delivery Center Romania extensive expertise and a strong track record in managing and delivering Cybersecurity services and solutions.\n\n**Adrian PAUL.** I love information technology, passionate to learn about it, and always looking to put the pieces together. Currently, in the conspicuous role of managing the Cyber Security Engineering team that is in charge of implementation, maintenance and development of multiple security services at Visma. When time permits, I enjoy running and volunteering.\n\n***\\~Security Log Management\\~***\nEnsuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the modern digital enterprise is not an easy task. It involves many parallel and related efforts, from systems engineering to effective cybersecurity policy and comprehensive workforce training. The essential elements in cybersecurity operations are monitoring, analyzing, responding to, and recovering from cyber attacks. Behind the scenes, programs and policies must be put into place to support cybersecurity operations.\n\nOrganizations are starting to use cloud computing to take advantage of its many benefits, including cost savings, quick time-to-market, and on-demand scaling of the environment. To improve security visibility in the cloud, security operations teams will want to develop a continuous monitoring strategy that uses a combination of cloud-native services and third-party options for the Security Log Management solution. The strategy needs to provide the most complete range of coverage for both proactively assessing the environment and detecting unusual events or anomalous behaviour rapidly. Additionally, a Security Log Management focused on automation and machine learning, alongside new and updated types of monitoring, will evolve into a Next-generation Security Information and Event Management (NG-SIEM) solution.\nLogging is a vital part of cybersecurity, as it enables you to detect breaches and identify their source. With a robust Security Log Management solution, you can monitor your environments for unusual activity and take action to stop it before it develops into a full-blown attack. By taking the time to develop a comprehensive logging strategy, you can not only mitigate the potential damage of a cyber attack, but also learn important lessons about how to improve your solution for the future\n\n**Lucian P\u0103tian** is a Cloud Solutions Architect at Haufe Group Timisoara. With a SysAdmin background, for the past four years, he has earned a reputation for finding creative solutions to problems in Cloud.\n\n***\\~ Improving security in AWS Cognito. \\~***\nAbstract: we will discuss about why using the standard configurations in Cognito can make your application a security honeypot. How can you use AWS WAF to add an extra layer of protection and why using verified token attributes should be a must."

One strategy that has proven to be highly effective is application modernization. This is not just a mere upgrade; it is a complete transformation of how businesses operate. By embracing this approach, companies can accelerate innovation, optimize costs, and improve their overall security posture.\n\nHowever, embarking on the journey of application modernization is not an easy task. It requires a significant investment in people, processes, and technology to achieve the desired business outcomes. The right foundation must be established from the beginning to avoid the high cost of re-architecture, which can be a major roadblock in achieving success. One crucial aspect is developing a standard and scalable security design for their Kubernetes environment. This will establish the framework for implementing the necessary checks, enforcement, and visibility to enable strategic business objectives.\n\nIn conclusion, application modernization is a strategic initiative that can transform businesses. Developing a standard and scalable security design for the Kubernetes environment is critical to establishing the framework for implementing the necessary checks, enforcement, and visibility to enable strategic business objectives.\n\n**Presenter:**\n\n**Regis Martins**\n\nRegis Martins is a passionate problem solver and technologist with a deep-rooted love for finding innovative solutions.
