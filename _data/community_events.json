Most of them bust their butts working 60+ hour weeks. They have no social lives. They're constantly exhausted. They roll around at night unable to sleep. And worse, every time they wake up there's always some fire they have to put out.</p> <p>It doesn't have to be that way.</p> <p>This session shows you the strategy that allows you to absolutely eliminate burnout, kick stress to the curb, reconnect to your purpose, and actually enjoy your work again.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Edwin Sarmientois the Managing Director of 15C, a consulting and training company that specializes in designing, implementing and supporting SQL Server infrastructures.

In this talk, Jeff will approach application security from the \u201cinside out\u201d. We will show you how to create simple agents that get inside a running application (like a profiler or debugger) and give you access to everything you might want to know. We\u2019ll demonstrate real agents that identify vulnerabilities without changing any code, scanning, or extra steps. We\u2019ll identify vulnerabilities, analyze access control, and even prevent RCE attacks. Unlike scanning and firewalling, this approach establishes a safe and powerful way for development, security, and operations teams to collaborate. We\u2019ll discuss how software security instrumentation works, how it\u2019s being used in many organizations, and the implications for the practice of application security.</p> <p>Bio: Jeff brings more than 20 years of security leadership experience as co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Contrast Security. He recently authored the DZone DevSecOps, IAST, and RASP refcards and speaks frequently at conferences including JavaOne (Java Rockstar), BlackHat, QCon, RSA, OWASP, Velocity, and PivotalOne. Jeff is also a founder and major contributor to OWASP, where he served as Global Chairman for 9 years, and created the OWASP Top 10, OWASPEnterprise Security API, OWASP Application Security Verification Standard, XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet, and many more popular open source projects.

        "description": "<p>Software developers were always left with two hard choices, either use security tools that are not built for them, or use free/open-source tools that generate too many false positives and have poor coverage. One of the prime reasons for this dilemma is that traditionally the security workload was managed by application security teams who would find vulnerabilities and filter through false positives. Now with agile development and DevOps workflows, now there is no option for developers to opt out of secure development.</p> <p>New technology called DataLog solves that problem in a fundamentally different way, giving developers new hope. During this presentation we will go over:<br/>- how static code analysis has changed over the years<br/>- how DataLog technology solves some of the inherent problems of static code analysis such as speed, accuracy and coverage<br/>- how concepts like treating code as data, and partial evaluations are changing the game completely<br/>- what developers can do today to get accuracy, speed, and coverage with SAST</p> <p>Speaker Bio<br/>Sherif Koussa is OWASP Ottawa Chapter Co-Leader, Software Developer, Hacker, and founder and CEO of Software Secured (<a href=\"https://www.softwaresecured.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.softwaresecured.com</a>) and Reshift (<a href=\"https://www.reshiftsecurity.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.reshiftsecurity.com</a>). In addition to contributing to OWASP Ottawa for over 14 years, Sherif contributed to WebGoat, and OWASP Cheat Sheets. Sherif also helped the SANS and GIAC organizations launch their GSSP-Java and GSSP-NET exams and contributed to a few of their courses. After switching from software development to the field of security, Sherif took on the mission of supporting developers shift security left, and ship more secure code organically. Whether through training, penetration testing as a service or coaching development teams through shifting security, Sherif believes that any AppSec without the developer wouldn\u2019t yield the best results. Sherif\u2019s current venture, Reshift Security, is a static code analysis tool that is built for developers with an experience from the IDE, over to the code review and CI phases.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Abstract:<br/>We\u2019re in the middle of a significant shift in how security teams operate and prioritize their limited budget and person-time. Historically, as an industry, we\u2019ve focused on building tools to identify vulnerabilities. While we\u2019ve built impressive tools, these approaches have failed to address the challenges of modern engineering teams. Specifically, these tools often are too slow, require a prohibitive amount of security engineer time and domain expertise to tune, overwhelm users with false positives, and most importantly, do not ultimately raise a company\u2019s security bar. But there\u2019s another way. Rather than investing in finding more bugs, some modern security teams are instead focusing on providing developers with frameworks and services with secure defaults (\u201cguard rails\u201d) so that developers can build features quickly and securely. When done correctly, combining secure defaults and lightweight checks that enforce invariants (properties that must always hold), organizations can solve *classes* of vulnerabilities by construction, preventing bug whack-a-mole. In this talk, we\u2019ll present a practical step-by-step methodology for:</p> <p>- Choosing what to focus your AppSec resources on<br/>- How to combine secure defaults + lightweight invariant enforcement to eradicate entire vulnerability classes<br/>- How to integrate continuous code scanning into your CI/CD processes in a way that\u2019s fast, high signal, and low friction for developers<br/>- How to use an open source, lightweight security linting tool to find bugs and anti-patterns specific to your company</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Grayson Hardaway is a security researcher at r2c, a startup working on static analysis tools purpose-built for the modern workflow. At r2c, Grayson authors static analysis tailored for finding security vulnerabilities in open source code. Previously, Grayson worked for the US Department of Defense fuzzing and exploiting obscure protocols.

Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.</p> <p>The Cyber Security and Networking (CSN) Research Group at Anglia Ruskin University has close working strategic relationships with industry, professional bodies, law enforcement, government agencies and academia in the delivery of operationally focused applied information and application security research. We have strong international links with professional organisations such as OWASP, BCS, ISC2, IISP &amp; the UK Cyber Security Forum amongst others. The primary aims of CSNRG are to help the UK and partner nations to tackle cybercrime, be more resilient to cyber attacks and educate its users for a more secure cyberspace and operational business environment. These will be achieved through the investigation of threats posed to information systems and understanding the impact of attacks and creation of cyber-based warning systems which gathering threat intelligence, automate threat detection, alert users and neutralising attacks. For network security we are researching securing the next generation of software defined infrastructures from the application API and control/data plane attacks.</p> <p>The BCS \u2013 Chartered Institute for IT - Cybercrime Forensics Special Interest Group (SG) promotes Cybercrime Forensics and the use of Cybercrime Forensics; of relevance to computing professionals, lawyers, law enforcement officers, academics and those interested in the use of Cybercrime Forensics and the need to address cybercrime for the benefit of those groups and of the wider public.</p> <p>Speaker Biographies &amp; Abstracts</p> <p>Christian Folini, Security Engineer, Netnea \u2013 \u201cOWASP Mod Security Core Rule Set CRS Project\u201d</p> <p>Bio: Christian Folini, Security Engineer, Netnea &amp; OWASP ModSecurity CRS Project Leader</p> <p>Christian Folini is a security engineer and open source enthusiast. He holds a Ph.D. in medieval history and enjoys defending castles across Europe. Unfortunately, defending medieval castles is not a big business anymore and he turned to defending web servers, which he finds equally challenging. He brings more than ten years of experience with ModSecurity configuration in high-security environments, DDoS defence, and threat modelling.</p> <p>Christian Folini is the author of the second edition of the ModSecurity Handbook and the best-known teacher on the subject. He co-leads the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set project and serves as the program chair of the \"Swiss Cyber Storm\" conference, the prime security conference in Switzerland.</p> <p>Abstract : \u201cOWASP Mod Security Core Rule Set CRS Project\u201d</p> <p>The CRS is a set of generic attack detection rules for use with ModSecurity or compatible web application firewalls. CRS is the 1st line of defence against web application attacks like those summarized in the OWASP Top Ten and all with a minimum of false alerts. This talk demonstrates the installation of the rule set and introduces the most important groups of rules. It covers key concepts like anomaly scoring and thresholds, paranoia levels, stricter siblings and the sampling mode. The important handling of false positives is also covered as well as pre-defined lists of rule exclusions for popular web applications helping to avoid false positives.</p> <p>Provisional Agenda</p> <p>18:00 - Webinar waiting lobby opens<br/>18:15 - Presentation followed by Questions and Answers<br/>19:30 - Closing, with virtual networking</p> "
