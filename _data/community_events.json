Similarly, CSA's IoT Working group is dedicated to understanding IoT deployments and defining actionable guidance to secure ecosystems. Their efforts are often used to develop medical security guidelines for developers and manufacturers alike but also to influence IoT security assessment methodologies for later use on commercial IoT certification schemes. This session will provide insights into current project initiatives, including those that directly impact medical devices and how you can save lives by getting involved.</p> <p>BIO: Aaron Guzman is a published author and a technical reviewer for several security books. He is the Head of Product &amp; Application Security with Cisco Meraki where he focuses on building security into enterprise IoT products and crafting designs that keep users safe from compromise. Aaron spearheads many open-source initiatives, raising awareness about IoT hacking and proactive defensive strategies under OWASP\u2019s IoT and Embedded Application Security projects. A co-chair of Cloud Security Alliance\u2019s IoT Working Group, he has extensive public speaking experience delivering conference presentations, training, and workshops globally.

Maybe it is better not to put it in your code, nor in your container. But what about Kubernetes? What about a custom secrets storage solution? Of course, we tried many, sometimes funny, things to get our secrets secured. And luckily we ended up with a combination of safe methods, with Vault at its core. Want to know more? Join us, as we will go through various examples and their challenges!</p> <p>Jeroen Willemsen is a Principal Security Architect at Xebia and a jack of all trades in security. He loves to develop new software, set up DevSecOps support tooling, and help companies with security programs. He enjoys sharing knowledge, which is why he published articles, blogs and gave trainings and talks about various subjects.</p> <p>Doing Security in DevOps, the right way!</p> <p>Automation is not DevSecOps, but without automation there is no DevSecOps! Secret management, SAST, DAST, Pen Testing, Container Security, Secure Config Management etc. are about automating security. But let me ask you, can one reach nirvana in securing DevOps with solely automation? This talk will address ALL dimensions required for doing security in DevOps, so we get it right!</p> <p>Irfaan Santoe is a Global Security Director at Wolters Kluwer advising the Business &amp; IT on the information security ambition &amp; implementation. Prior to Wolters Kluwer, Irfaan was the Global Head of Security Engineering at ABN AMRO bank and lead the security implementation of ABN AMRO\u2019s IT transformation towards DevOps. This transformation program is set to uplift more than 500+ Dev-teams to become DevOps and increasing security without breaking DevOps! Irfaan is a Master in Computer Science (a programmer by heart) and is fascinated by the Inner Science of Yoga &amp; Meditation.</p> <p>The YouTube link will be added to this page.</p> "

Static activities have context and depth, but lack visibility on the true behavior of the software. On the other hand, runtime activities have no direct access to the internals of the application because they follow an external approach.</p> <p>DevOps teams are demanding a more complete picture of the security of the applications, combining static and dynamic activities. In this practical talk, I want to propose a new approach based on runtime observability, that provides not only vulnerabilities and attacks, but also app deployment intelligence, sensitive data visibility, and API discovery capabilities.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Daniel Blazquez leads the technical marketing and developer advocacy practice at Hdiv Security, a VC-funded application security company focused on application security automation. As an ex-Java programmer and recovering corporate strategy professional, Daniel brings a holistic view to the S-SDLC practice: from coding to product management, all the way to growth strategy. His education includes a Computer Science master's and undergrad, and an MBA at UCLA Anderson.</p> <p>Our meeting sponsor, Shiftleft, will provide a $40 Amazon gift card to all attendees who fill out our survey during the meeting. The URL for the survey will be given out during the meeting.</p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>NOTE: Due to the continuing health concerns relating to the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we will be meeting virtually until further notice.</p> "

The fact that new data breaches, security vulnerabilities, ransomware and physical impacts of cyber-attacks are published daily in the news underlines the fact even more.</p> <p>This talk explains why it is crucial to have security skills in every IT engineering team and why you cannot solely rely on a centralized security department - especially not in the agile world. Next to personal skills, this talk focuses on security best practices in software development. The speaker will highlight topics such as automated security testing methods and give recommendations on invaluable manual periodic security assessments.</p> <p>This presentation is based on the speaker's personal experience and includes many learning's and tips from throughout his career. For example, how-to decide where it is absolutely necessary to invest 100% security effort and where the 80/20 principle is more than enough. Or also, why it is crucial to have a security baseline established, before thinking about a Bug-Bounty program.</p> <p>About Manuel Cianci<br/>Manuel has been a security enthusiast forever. Manuel started his technical security journey when he was 16 years old. His professional security career started some years later as a Security Software Engineer. In order to learn as many technical basics as possible, Manuel worked within different Security Software Engineering positions for more than eight years. Afterwards, he moved to a role as Security Engineer and Security Consultant.</p> <p>For the last three years, Manuel was managing and leading the Security Delivery team of Swisscom. Manuel and his team were responsible for security engineering, consulting, and coaching services for the entire company. During his time at Swisscom, Manuel has been working on many subject areas in the security field.
