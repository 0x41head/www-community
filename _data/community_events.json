TLS 1.3 is a great development in the secure transmission of data. But there\u2019s a few security challenges that we need to be ready for. In this talk, I will present the current threat landscape and possible mitigation to some of the known malicious usages of the new privacy features implemented in TLS1.3. We will discuss the impact of TLS 1.3 on Network-based security solutions used by enterprises and public sector given that the several changes introduced in TLS 1.3 have a good goal to improve the overall security and privacy provided. However, some of these changes have a negative impact on network-based security solutions</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Khalid Alsuwaiyel is a Senior Incident Response Consultant in IBM X-Force IR team.

It's like a code-aware grep, enabling you to easily search for complicated code patterns without writing painful abstract syntax tree (AST) visitors or using heavyweight, expensive, proprietary traditional SAST tools.</p> <p>Key Semgrep features:<br/>- Fast - scans code in minutes, not hours or days.<br/>- Does not require the source code you\u2019re scanning to be buildable.<br/>- Comes out of the box with over 1,000 open source rules covering the OWASP Top 10 and more.<br/>- Supports languages including Python, Java, Golang, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and more on the way.<br/>- Autofix - Don't just point out bugs, help developers fix them!<br/>- Most importantly, Semgrep makes it easy to write custom rules, no fancy DSL required. This empowers AppSec engineers and developers to detect and block company-specific security bugs and anti-patterns as well as enforce best practices.</p> <p>We\u2019ll demo how to easily write custom Semgrep rules tailored to your specific code base, and how to get continuous security coverage in CI in a just a few minutes.</p> <p>Bio: Clint Gibler (@clintgibler) is the Head of Security Research for r2c, a startup working on giving security tools directly to developers. Previously, Clint was a Research Director at NCC Group, a global security consulting firm, where he helped companies implement security automation and DevSecOps best practices as well as performed penetration tests for companies ranging from large enterprises to new startups.

Logs are so much more than just for debugging, mapping system performance or error finding. They tell the tales of what has occurred in a system at any given time. When things never go right I believe one should push left. This means if we do not have logs in Application Development we can use for when a breach occurs we should build them. These philosophies focusses on five things that will help your application logs become more than just there for debugging and performance, they build in forensic readiness for future breaches, it also deals with sensitive data disclosure.</p> <p>Veronica started her forensic career in 2008. She is the Director of Incident Response within DFIRLABS. Veronica is also an Assistant Professor at Noroff University.
