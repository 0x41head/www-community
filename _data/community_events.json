For those attending in-person, the doors open at 6pm, and those joining us virtually the presentation will start at 6:30pm.\n\nThis month we will be welcoming Tommaso Innocenti to talk about his research on OAuth2.0 redirection URIs.\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\nTommaso is a fourth-year Ph.D. student advised by Engin Kirda, working as a Secure Systems Lab (SecLab) member at Northeastern University. His interests revolve around Privacy and Security, with particular attention to increasing final users' security. His works reflect his passion and tenacity in exploring complex security topics. His most recent work focuses on the security of the OAuth protocol.\n\nABSTRACT\nOAuth 2.0 requires a complex redirection trail between websites and Identity Providers (IdPs). In particular, the \"redirect URI\" parameter included in the popular Authorization Grant Code flow governs the callback endpoint to which users are routed, together with their security tokens.\n\nIn this talk, I will present recent attack trends in conjunction with the research trends to identify the source of the problem that allowed us to generate our hypothesis.\n\nBased on this observation, I will present novel attack techniques and the experiment that allowed us to verify that the OAuth 2.0 security guidance is under-specified empirically. Finally, I will explain end-to-end attack scenarios that combine our attack techniques with common web application vulnerabilities, ultimately resulting in a complete compromise of the secure delegated access that OAuth 2.0 promises."

In modern applications, the majority of code on which an application is built isn\u2019t code written by your team. Modern applications are built on the backs of volunteer communities and open-source software. These volunteers and their software delivery practices all become potential attack vectors. The truth is that most organizations do not factor open-source supply chain attacks into their organization\u2019s threat models today. Security incidents such as the CodeCov bash uploader script, the npm colors, and faker intentionally introduced malicious commits, and the recent PyPi backdoors targeting AWS credentials highlight the impact of supply chain attacks as a scalable attack pattern. To spread awareness on supply chain attacks so that organizations can scalably handle them we propose baking supply chain attacks into existing threat modeling procedures and software development culture so that organizations can champion supply chain management of open source in the places where they are most impactful, at development time. We will present a comprehensive, comprehensible, and technology-agnostic taxonomy of attack vectors, created on the basis of hundreds of real-world incidents and validated by experts in the domain. Following, we will discuss the types of defenses you can put in place to detect and respond to such modern day attacks and how you can work these defenses in based on your program\u2019s maturity"

Learn From Others in the DevOps and DevSecOps Communities\nLook to the DevOps community to help close your critical knowledge gaps.\n2. 2\\. Start With Your Container Security\nThe first step to building out the security of your DevOps toolchain starts with your container security.\n3. Institute Continuous Compliance\nDevSecOps is a platform for continuous compliance to protect your software supply chains against vulnerable packages and vulnerable configurations.\n4. Double Down on Automation\nWhile you may have already been experimenting with automation during your DevOps phase, it only becomes more integral once you throw the switch in by going DevSecOps. Go into your DevOps to DevSecOps transformation with an automation strategy that focuses on automating common developer and sysadmin tasks.\n5. Improve Your Monitoring and Analytics\nBuilding out a DevSecOps toolchain takes your monitoring and analytics options to a new level. Consider the fact that you should already collect and publish data from your toolchain and deliver reports to your project managers, developers, QA testers, and stakeholders outside your team. Commonly, DevOps reporting is still a work in progress for organizations. Use the introduction of new security tools into your toolchain as a chance to offer more granular and real-time security reporting into all parts of your DevSecOps toolchain.\n6. Implement Accessibility Assurance\nDepending on your organization\u2019s definition of compliance, the option is there to add accessibility compliance or Section 508 to your DevSecOps toolchain.\n\nThis hands-on training is reserver for 70% professional and 30% students.\n\nMandatory:\n\nGeneral Conditions in order to validate your participation to this event:\n\n1\\. Student must send University/Student ID\\, otherwise registration will be rejected\\.\n\n2.Professional must register company emails, otherwise registration will be rejected.\n\nRegistration only via EventBrite. We don't accept answer via meetup.\n\nPlease indicate your firstname, lastname, company name, a valid business email or school email (email like gmai, free, hotmail, outlook, etc are not accepted and registration will be cancelled).\n\nPlease register here:\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/billets-devsecops-toolchain-transformation-374188276207"
