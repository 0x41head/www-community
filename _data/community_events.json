The rise of corresponding security incidents demonstrates that adversaries discovered those attack vectors as a viable and scalable attack pattern."

This\nworkshop aims to arm participants with practical knowledge and hands-on experience to secure\nAPIs effectively.\nIn this workshop, we will be using OWASP crAPI (completely ridiculous API), a purposely\ninsecure API, to demonstrate common API vulnerabilities and their mitigations. We will discuss\nthe 'Shift Left' approach in API security, emphasizing the importance of integrating security\nmeasures early in the development lifecycle. Participants will learn to identify, exploit, and\nsecure API vulnerabilities, equipping them with the necessary skills to build more secure\napplications\n\n**Presenter Bio:**\n1\\. Jayesh Ahire is the Product Manager at TraceableAI where he works on the Company\u2019s\nAPI Security initiative. He is the maintainer of OWASP crAPI, Hypertrace, and many\nother notable OSS Projects. He is AWS ML Hero, Twilio champion, and runs API\nSecurity Global Community. He also runs AWS UG, Elastic UG, TensorFlow UG, and\nmany other communities in US and India. His research interest involved Distributed\nneural computers and Defi. In his free time, he likes to read and these days he is\nlearning to play the piano.\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayesh-ahire/\n\n**Requirements**:\n1\\. Active Participation: The workshop will be highly interactive\\. Questions\\, comments\\, and\nsharing of experiences are strongly encouraged.\n2\\. Laptop: As this is an in\\-person workshop\\, please bring along your laptop with any API\ntesting tool installed.\n3\\. Pre\\-workshop Material: On confirmation of your attendance\\, you will receive some\npre-workshop reading materials. We recommend reviewing these before the event to\nmaximize your learning experience."

A new and unique security condition has emerged that has no IOC\u2019s or TTP\u2019s. However, it is arguably the most dangerous of all emerging threats. If exploited, it can alter elections, destabilize governments, and bring a swift end to truth and the institutions that rely on truth. The future of information security is detecting and preventing the spread of \u201cdisinformation\u201d.\n\nPart 1 of this series focused on the origins of \u201cactive measures\u201d in the Cold War and the events leading up to January 6th 2021. Part 2 of this series, will focus on a new framework to map disinformation tactics and techniques, and the impact AI based chatbots and \u201cdeepfake\u201d technology will have on the future of democracy.\n\nWithout trust, democracy has no future. Can the security community help to restore trust in information and save democracy for posterity?\n\n**Bio:**\nBrandon has over 12 years of IT/InfoSec experience working as a server admin, network engineer, and security engineer. Brandon currently serves as Senior Threat Detection Engineer for BlackBerry Cybersecurity unit. Brandon is also a visiting fellow at *The National Security Institute (NSI) at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School.* Brandon received his B.A. in Business Economics from the University of California, Irvine. Outside of InfoSec, Brandon is an avid hunter, backpacker, and \u201cbeach bum\u201d.\n\n**Speaker 2:** Lori Barfield, ShellCon RaiseMe / US Coast Guard Auxiliary\n**Topic 2:** How Volunteer Work Can Work for You\n\n**Abstract:**\nThere\u2019s a crushing Catch-22 in the technology world that keeps people from realizing their career dreams. Career consultants often hear this exasperated plea for help: \u201cHow do I get experience doing something new, when the companies I am talking to only want to hire people who already have experience?\u201d Lori is a former computer engineer and technology executive who will explain how candidates can gain key engineering work experience by volunteering. Volunteers participate in a very wide range of opportunities: from meetups to open source projects to service to the country. This talk will explain how to leverage a volunteer accomplishment with strategic integration into resumes and job interviews.\n\n**Bio:**\nLori Barfield joined her first Internet startup during the original .com boom as a Senior System Administrator, at a company that eventually went public. After moving into leadership there, she started an international executive consulting practice.\nLori\u2019s volunteer career began as a Chair for the Southern California Linux Expo. She has been a conference organizer and speaker in the Open Source world for 15 years. She also co-founded the cyber security conference ShellCon in 2017, and RaiseMe IT along with that. Through RaiseMe she has spoken and taught about career development at dozens of technical events across the country. Five years ago, Lori answered the call to duty and joined the Coast Guard Auxiliary.

Then I will discuss how you can add security into these in a way that respects your development/SRE teams. Allowing teams to manage and configure their tools independently and in a distributed manner, while still having centralized visibility (through logs and metrics extracted from their pipelines, with associated dashboards and SLA/O/Is) and the ability to quickly deploy new IaC-specific security policies. We will also discuss a reasonable onramp \u2013 ensuring that teams don't need to triage piles of findings only to discover that most of them are false positives or low-priority noise. This will include a discussion of a real world roll-out, and a method that was developed to add passive security scans into existing IaC pipelines with no changes other than running the existing commands (terraform, ansible, etc.) inside of a new docker container."

Se proporciona a los asistentes una imagen virtual de Kali Linux preconfigurada con las herramientas necesarias para realizar el taller. Se necesita Virtualbox o VMWare para ejecutarla. Si tus recursos no son suficientes tendr\u00e1s que seguir tutoriales para instalar un proxy de ataque (Burp Suite Community u OWASP ZAP) y Juice Shop (servidor local o con Docker).\n\nLa imagen se puede descargar de ac\u00e1: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qjXU4Ea8KB0MTc3WRQ7eVDNMOXaxawB9/](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qjXU4Ea8KB0MTc3WRQ7eVDNMOXaxawB9/)\n\nPara aprovechar mejor el tiempo y el ancho de banda se recomienda asistir con todo pronto.

        "description": "Web APIs are a common glue that connect people and processes with digital systems all across the globe. Not surprisingly, Web APIs contribute more than 80% of the Internet traffic today. Given the importance of APIs, OWASP has recommended top-10 API specific security vulnerabilities (such as Broken Authentication/Authorization and Excessive Data Exposure problems) that organizations must address to strengthen their security posture. Albeit useful, these API specific vulnerabilities do not necessarily translate to the same business risks. For instance, two APIs from an organization with Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) may pose very different business risks to that organization.\n\nIn this session, we'll talk about API Risk Rating System (ARRS) that maps API specific vulnerabilities to business risks such as Legal/Contractual, Operational, Financial, Reputational and Regulatory. Similar in-principle yet different than Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), the main objective of ARRS is to prioritize API specific vulnerabilities based on their business risks. We'll describe the methodology behind the system developed using thousands of APIs that are being tracked at a global scale. We\u2019ll also share some hands-on practical scenarios.\n\nThe work presented was done by Samantha Sanchez, Jun Hee Lee, Alberto Ciconi and Baljeet Malhotra. Samantha, Jun Hee and Alberto are MSc Cybersecurity students at NYIT. Baljeet is an Adjunct Professor at NYIT, UBC, UVic, UNBC, and CEO of TeejLab Inc.\n\n**Location TBD**"
