It's a foundational part of building a security culture and uncovers potential security issues before they slip into production.\nProactively protecting data from the app to the API requires modeling potential attacks to mitigate weak points before bad actors find them. A team of 15 security veterans and experts, including Chris Romeo, CEO of Security journey, created the Threat Modeling Manifesto. Chris is a veteran security expert focused on developing a security culture through training and education. During this session, he will discuss why a manifesto, how you can use it as a foundational piece of your threat modeling program, and practical application tips for building an Enterprise-class threat modeling program.\n\nBio:\n\nChris Romeo is CEO and co-founder of Security Journey and is a builder of security culture influencing education.

Moshe Zioni is the VP of Security Research at Apiiro, He is listed as 27 influential penetration testers in 2020 by Peerlyst and have been researching cybersecurity for over 20 years in multiple domains and industries. Liri Sokol is the first employee and technical leader at Apiiro, Liri has a strong background in design and implementation of complex systems from backend to frontend.\n\nKubernetes poses quite a few security challenges, one of the more interesting and central components of it is the API Server. We are going to walk through its past vulnerabilities and security pain points, and finally, how can one remediate those and similar gaps in the future.\n\n18:45 to 19:15 Session #2 - APIs Posture Management and the Extinction of Rogue APIs\n\nAner Morag, VP of Technology at Noname Security. Leading the Detection, Research and Innovation of the company.\n\nWhat is a good/secured API? How do you even measure the risks of your APIs when most part of your environment is unknown - even if an API-GW is in place, risks like data exposure and broken authentication mechanism are a common misconfiguration.\nMaintaining an up-to-date posture of your APIs is starting with their detection, cloud/infrastructure routing, while also including exposure / usage of sensitive data, IAAA functionality, or public access.\n\n19:15 - 19:30\nBreak\n\n19:30 to 20:00 - Session #3 - HTTP Smuggling from inception to nowadays\n\nJoin Milan Charniak, Red Teamer and Penetration Tester at Cilynx. Milan is an experienced Red Teamer that has experience in the detection / operations domains as well.\n\nThe lecture is discussing HTTP Smuggling attacks from inception to this day while sharing some real exploitation successes.\nWe will cover how HTTP Smuggling attacks are performed, from the classic HTTP Smuggling attack to the more recent HTTP 2.0\nAsync Smuggling attacks. A variety of examples will be technically described and presented."

Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs.\n\nYou may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues.\n\nGartner has actually predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks.\n\nThis session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks. We\u2019ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management ."
