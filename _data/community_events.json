        "description": "En esta reunion platicaremos de:\n\nZero Trust for API Risk Management\nSpeaker: Dr. Baljeet Malhotra\n\nAbstract: Web applications are prone to various cybersecurity risks. Did you know that 96% of these web applications contain some Open Source? Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs. You may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues. Gartner has actually predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks. This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use for managing their API risks. We\u2019ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management.\n\nTambi\u00e9n nos pueden encontrar en:\n\nOWASP: https://owasp.org/www-chapter-aguascalientes/\nFB: https://www.facebook.com/OWASPAguascalientes/\nYT: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4EL3F0TTjFcdua3j74kzTw"

Your company literally can scale at the click of a button. But if you take the simplicity of the cloud for granted, you wind up with brittle security that even a novice adversary can overcome. This talk will focus on identifying the holes in your cloud application before the attackers do, closing those gaps, and building architectures that can withstand the barrage of attacks that the Internet will throw at it.\n\nBio:\n\nJosh Sokol, CISSP, graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BS in Computer Science in 2002. Since that time, he has worked for several large companies, including AMD and BearingPoint, spent some time as a military contractor, and recently left a ten year career as the Information Security Program Owner at National Instruments in order to pursue a full-time role as the Creator, CEO, and CISO of the free and open source risk management tool named SimpleRisk. Josh has spoken on dozens of security topics, including the much-hyped \u201cHTTPSCan Byte Me\u201d talk at Black Hat 2010, and served for four years on the OWASP Global Board of Directors."

He found a class of issues in Python. It\u2019s hard to tell how bad it is: one person said \u201cI hope you\u2019re wrong\u201d and one said, \u201cWow. What. A. Mess.\u201d But when it comes down to it, he found a very difficult to diagnose class of logic-flaws, the existence of which is even harder to test for safely. Thankfully, Python is only mainly used for scientific, academic, back-end and monetary systems\u2026 right? Right.\n\nBIO: Robert Hansen is a 27-year veteran in computer security, known to many in the industry by handle \"RSnake\". Robert started his career at eBay, where he was responsible for authentication as well as most anti-fraud systems and anti-phishing technologies. His work at eBay was later built into every modern web browser and is now protecting every Internet user as a result. His site, ha.ckers.org, was at one point responsible for a third of all the top-ranked web vulnerabilities when it was live.\n\nAt SecTheory he hacked into the back ends of over 2,100 banks, credit card processors, flight control systems, SCADA (water and power) control systems, and other security companies. During this time, Robert also built the most secure web application security hosting platform in the world at Falling Rock Networks, surviving over 15 million attacks in 8 years.\n\nMost recently, Robert's corporate intelligence platform, OutsideIntel, was acquired by Bit Discovery after which he became the CTO. Robert has worked as a floating CISO for multiple companies and sits on advisory boards of multiple technology and security companies such as Arkose Labs.\n\nMeeting info will be available on meetup - BE SURE TO RSVP to access the link\n\nATTENTION SPONSORS: YOUR NAME COULD BE HERE\nContact sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

In fact, web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet.This growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks.\n\nIn this session, Dr Baljeet Malhotra will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks. He\u2019ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management.\n\nAPIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, and competitive differentiation, but their weak security posture leads to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues. Gartner has actually predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications.\n\nGiven the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks.\n\nDr Baljeet Malhotra, is an award-winning researcher known for his work in Open Source and API Data Management. He conceptualized the world's first \"API Composition Analysis\" based on source code static analysis. He currently holds Adjunct Professor positions at the University of British Columbia, University of Victoria and University of Northern BC."

As supporters and contributors to the Mobile Security Project at OWASP, we have pen tested thousands of mobile apps and scanned millions of commercial apps in the app stores over the years\u2026 and have identified the most common security issues that plague developers and security teams. Whether you are new to mobile pen testing or a veteran looking for the latest tools and tactics, join this session to learn 10 keys to mobile appsec leveraging OWASP MASVS and practical real-world experience.\n\nPresenter:\n\nAs Chief Mobility Officer, Brian Reed leads the mobile standards and mobile DevSecOps charge at NowSecure helping orgs deliver secure mobile apps faster. He brings decades of experience in mobile, apps, security, dev, and testing helping Fortune 2000 global customers, federal agencies and mobile innovators. Brian is a compelling storyteller, speaker and writer including OWASP, AllDayDevOps, DevOpsWorld, DevOps Days, RSA, Droidcon, Mobile World Congress, FS-ISAC, and more.

Be the darling of bug bounty managers and the envy of security researchers.\n\nWe'll introduce the 3 solutions that powered this massive fix: CodeQL, GitHub's code query language that finds security vulnerability patterns at scale, and OpenRewrite, a style-preserving refactoring tool used at Netflix that makes the changes to these problems you found, and a custom-built bot for generating these thousands of pull requests.\n\nThis episode will take you on a journey through what it means to be an \u201cOpen Source Security Researcher\u201d and how CodeQL + Rewrite are serious game-changers from the solutions that existed before.\n\nJONATHAN LEITSCHUH\nJonathan Leitschuh is a Software Engineer and Security Researcher. His research focuses on Open Source Software (OSS), build infrastructure, and software supply chain security. He's best known for his July 2019 bombshell Zoom 0-day vulnerability disclosure. He also championed an industry-wide initiative to get all major artifact servers in the JVM ecosystem to formally decommission the support of HTTP in favor of HTTPS only. In his free time, he contributes to OSS by finding and reporting security vulnerabilities to popular OSS projects.
