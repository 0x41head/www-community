We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.\" The Internet of today is an amazing place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr. Barlow's original vision.\n\nIn the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis, state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars. We must be free to communicate and associate without fear. To realize our right to privacy and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions. CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to privacy and anonymity online. Topics include technologies like TOR, full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more. CryptoParties are free to attend, public, and not commercially aligned.\n\nAt our January 31, 2023 OWASP Austin meeting, we will host a CryptoParty with the goal of inviting others to join us in learning about the tools and technologies that enable an individual's right to privacy. When the time comes, we will encourage you all to invite your family, friends, and peers to attend this event, but for now, I am looking for others who are willing to give a 10 minute max presentation on a crypto-oriented subject. The presentation will need to be laid out so that novice and experienced alike can take action based on the data presented. All tools must be free and open source. If you are interested in presenting, please e-mail me directly (do not reply to the list) with your name, bio, talk title, and abstract for consideration. This is going to be EPIC!"

The supply chain is at the heart of developing, delivering, maintaining, and scaling applications. It is critical to understand the risk in each component in order to safeguard the supply chain. End-to-end security is critical to mitigating the risks associated with open source software, regardless of the application that is being created.\nIn this talk, we will look at the challenges associated with the \"Container\" supply chain, as well as some of the technology, processes, and tools that you can use to create confidence in your container supply chain.\n\n**Talk#2** : **Every risk is not a CVE: Bolster up against software supply chain attacks**\n\n###\n\n**Speaker:** Varun Badhwar, Founder/CEO of Endor Labs\n3rd party and open source software components are both desired and indispensable ingredients used throughout the development lifecycle, but their consumption comes with considerable security risks, both for the developer herself and her downstream users. The rise of corresponding security incidents demonstrates that adversaries discovered those attack vectors as a viable and scalable attack pattern.\n\nWe will present a comprehensive, comprehensible and technology-agnostic[ ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04008)taxonomy of attack vectors, created on the basis of hundreds of real-world incidents, and validated by experts in the domain. An interactive visualization of this taxonomy,[ ](https://riskexplorer.endorlabs.com/)available as open source itself, will be demoed throughout the talk to explain different techniques at the disposal of attackers, supported by real-world examples.\n\nFollowing, we will discuss the types of defenses you can put in place to detect and respond to such modern day attacks.\n\nLooking forward to connecting at the Security Meetup"

Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.\n\nThe **Cyber Security and Networking** (**CSN**) Research Group at Anglia Ruskin University has close working strategic relationships with industry, professional bodies, law enforcement, government agencies and academia in the delivery of operationally focused applied information and application security research. We have strong international links with professional organisations such as OWASP, BCS, ISC2, IISP & the UK Cyber Security Forum amongst others. The primary aims of CSNRG are to help the UK and partner nations to tackle cybercrime, be more resilient to cyber attacks and educate its users for a more secure cyberspace and operational business environment. These will be achieved through the investigation of threats posed to information systems and understanding the impact of attacks and creation of cyber-based warning systems which gathering threat intelligence, automate threat detection, alert users and neutralising attacks. For network security we are researching securing the next generation of software defined infrastructures from the application API and control/data plane attacks. Other key work includes Computer forensic analysis, digital evidence crime scenes and evidence visualisation as well as Cyber educational approaches such as developing Capture the Flag (CTF) resources and application security programs.\n\n**Abstract : \u201cAutomation of digital crime investigation using Reinforcement Learning (RL)\u201d**\n\nCurrent human-led Digital Investigation is reaching its limit, notably with the explosive increase in cybercrime. DFIR practitioners at law enforcement and corporate levels are facing severe challenges in coping with the demand. This talk will discuss the possible use of new Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches to automate and optimise some of the processes in DFIR practice and thus off-load experts and increase efficiency.\n\n**Provisional Agenda**\n\n16:45 - Webinar waiting lobby opens\n17:00 - Start of Presentation\n17:50 \u2013 Questions & Answers"

        "description": "**TOPIC**: Every Risk is Not a CVE: Bolster up Against Software Supply Chain Attacks\nJoin us for great networking, dinner and drinks, and see a presentation by Jamie Scott - Product Manager\n\n**ABSTRACT**: 3rd party and open source software components are both desired and indispensable ingredients used throughout the development lifecycle, but their consumption comes with considerable security risks, both for the developer herself and her downstream users. The rise of corresponding security incidents demonstrates that adversaries discovered those attack vectors as a viable and scalable attack pattern.\nWe will present a comprehensive, comprehensible and technology-agnostic taxonomy of attack vectors, created on the basis of hundreds of real-world incidents, and validated by experts in the domain. An interactive visualization of this taxonomy, available as open source itself, will be demoed throughout the talk to explain different techniques at the disposal of attackers, supported by real-world examples.\nFollowing, we will discuss the types of defenses you can put in place to detect and respond to such modern day attacks.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: Endor Labs\nEndor Labs\u2019 Dependency Lifecycle Management Platform is designed to address the weakest link in software supply chain security: the ungoverned sprawl of open source software in the enterprise. Endor Labs\u2019 mission is to help developers spend less time dealing with security issues and more time accelerating development through safe code reuse. With this solution, development and security teams are able to maximize software reuse by safely evaluating, maintaining, and updating dependencies at scale.\n\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*"

        "description": "**NOTE: IN-PERSON EVENT**\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe increased pressure for cybersecurity practices, even in their earliest stages, is becoming a common demand from both customers and investors. With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scale. Establishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, lightweight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n### **Code of Conduct**\n\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone. Please reach out to one of our chapter leaders if you have any feedback/concerns or would like to speak to us, we take these matters very seriously.
