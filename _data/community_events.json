Next, general observations about the most popular open source license and compliance challenges will be addressed. Specific focus will be made on the key permissive and \u201ccopyleft\u201d licenses such as the MIT/BSD and GPL/AGPL respectively and touch on the emergence of source available licenses (MongoDB). This will include license interpretation and compliance challenges and enforcement actions.</p> <p>The conversation will then shift to open source and security. The unique challenges posed by open source will be discussed along with some ideas on how to address these challenges. We\u2019ll also spend a few moments analyzing the security breach at Equifax and exploring how mismanaged open source components were the root cause of that breach.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Matthew Jacobs was Vice President and General Counsel at Black Duck Software, Inc., recently acquired by Synopsys, Inc. He is now a director with the legal group at Synopsys. Organizations worldwide use Synopsys\u2019s industry-leading products to secure and manage open source software, eliminating the pain related to security vulnerabilities, compliance and operational risk. Matt\u2019s work at Synopsys includes managing licensing and contract negotiation and advising senior management on day-to-day legal affairs. In addition to being a frequent speaker on open source\u2013related topics, Matt routinely advises Synopsys\u2019s customers with respect to leading-edge open source adoption, use and compliance matters.</p> <p>Prior to joining Black Duck in 2009, Matt was with Bernstein Shur, where he counseled companies on a variety of intellectual property matters, including open source compliance.

But for now we will continue to host online meetups.</p> <p>See you!</p> <p>------------------------<br/>Security+Ambidexterity+Devops = FUN - Espen Johansen (Visma)</p> <p>I dette foredraget vil Espen snakke dypere om de tekniske valgene som er gjort hos Visma fra starten av DevOps transformasjonen fram til i dag. Han vil ogs\u00e5 demonstrere hvordan noen av systemene virker i praksis og gi salen mulighet til \u00e5 styre han :-) Interaktivt foredrag med store muligheter til \u00e5 f\u00e5 innsyn.</p> <p>Experience sharing and storytelling from Visma`s work with integrating security into DevOps by means of Ambidexterity as method. Practical examples on choice of leaders, board composition, spices with technical choices made along the way.</p> <p>Espen is a passionate Security DevOps-er with a flair for midlifecrisemanagement and enjoying life to it\u2019s fullest. He serves as the Director of Security in Visma but is secretly passionate about gamification, UX, Democracy and Security. He loves difficult words and like to apply their meaning in agile teams.</p> <p>------------------------<br/>Dependency Confusion - St\u00e5le Pettersen (Schibsted)</p> <p>Are you confused about the Dependency Confusion attack? We will explain the bug class that compromised Apple, Microsoft and Tesla, and how you can defend yourself against it in the different package manager systems (npm, python, Java, Ruby and more). We will go through how the Product &amp; Application Security team in Schibsted worked to mitigate this bug class in JFrog Artifactory. One part of our solution was the tool Artishock (<a href=\"https://github.com/schibsted/artishock\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/schibsted/artishock</a>).</p> <p>St\u00e5le Pettersen (@kozmic) is leading the Product &amp; Application Security team within Schibsted.

Threat modeling is considered to be a key activity, but can be challenging to perform for developers, and even more so in agile software development. Hence, threat modeling has not seen widespread use in agile software projects. The goal of the presentation is to show some of these challenges and approaches that the teams are working on.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Dr. Monica Iovan, Head of Security Development, Visma; In her free time, Monica enjoys peaceful moments in nature and the company of a good book. She is a passionate researcher having the goal of simplifying the use of security services within Agile development. She leads the security development team in Visma and conducts research on security in agile software development.<br/>Dr. Daniela S.

Dr. Daniela Cruzes received her PhD in experimental software engineering from the University of Campinas - UNICAMP in Brazil in 2007. Her research interests are empirical software engineering, research methods and theory development, synthesis of SE studies, software security, software testing and agile and DevOps.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;Abstract - Security through an iterative process<br/>Security through an iterative process is a collection of notes collected in 15+ years\u2019 experience. We will go through what has worked for most companies, some myths and some of the common things that are typically missing, but that everybody wants.</p> <p>Bio:</p> "

Despite the benefits threat modeling provides, most development teams don't know how to get started in this practice. This evening's presentation will provide high-level answers to your \"Five Ws\" questions about threat modeling, including: What is a Threat Model? Who should be involved in creating the model? What should the model contain? and, most importantly, How do I create the model?</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Dr. John DiLeo is the Auckland-area leader of the OWASP New Zealand Chapter.

Logs are so much more than just for debugging, mapping system performance or error finding. They tell the tales of what has occurred in a system at any given time. When things never go right I believe one should push left. This means if we do not have logs in Application Development we can use for when a breach occurs we should build them. These philosophies focusses on five things that will help your application logs become more than just there for debugging and performance, they build in forensic readiness for future breaches, it also deals with sensitive data disclosure.</p> <p>Veronica started her forensic career in 2008. She is the Director of Incident Response within DFIRLABS. Veronica is also an Assistant Professor at Noroff University. Veronica holds a Master in Science at Rhodes University in Information Security with specialisation in the forensic analysis of malware. She prides herself in keeping patients safe as this is something which is near to her heart. She is also a cyborg sporting an embedded medical device herself. She also is a DEF CON Goon and she is the founder of DC2751.<br/>Her particular research interests include research into security vulnerabilities in medical devices forming part of the Internet of Things, and how these could be exploited by malicious attackers, as well as what types of forensic artefacts could be identified from any attacks. She is extremely passionate about protecting people whose lives depend on these medical devices, and her passion saw her becoming a researcher within an MDM. She is also developing a digital forensics and incident response approach dealing specifically with implanted medical devices and medical devices installed within a healthcare setting. At her core Veronica is a forensicator and hacker and in love with every bit, byte and nibble of knowledge she has obtained. She recently launched an OWASP project and infiltrated development teams to learn to be green. She is passionate about when things do not go right you push left.</p> "
