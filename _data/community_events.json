But they do not get more experienced than these two!</p> <p>In my career path in IT security a handful of people stands out as having had the biggest influence and impact. Two of these are Richard Campbell (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/richjcampbell/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/richjcampbell/</a>) and Paula Januszkiewicz (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulajanuszkiewicz/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulajanuszkiewicz/</a>) and it is therefore a bit of a dream come true that we got them to speak at our meetup \u2013 And at the same meetup!</p> <p>Richard is probably best known from RunAsRadio (<a href=\"https://runasradio.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://runasradio.com</a>) and DotNetRocks (<a href=\"https://www.dotnetrocks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.dotnetrocks.com/</a>) and there have been days in my career where I have found myself talking more back at his podcast then I have talked with my wife that day!</p> <p>Paula is the founder and CEO of CQURE and has been giving presentations on security longer than I can remember. I try to listen/watch as many of them as possible because I always learn something and I am always entertained when she talks! And as she writes on her CV \u201cShe has access to the source code of Windows\u201d</p> <p>Mark this time and come join us!</p> <p>This event is purely virtual but feel free to meetup in groups and it will be updated with more information about the presentations later. It will be held in English</p> <p>The meetup will not be recorded.</p> <p>I will update this page with more information very shortly!</p> "

He conceptualized the world's first \"API Composition Analysis\" based on source code static analysis. He founded TeejLab in 2017 and steered the team to build API Discovery and Security\u2122, world's first comprehensive end-to-end API Management platform. Prior to TeejLab, he established the R&amp;D unit of Black Duck Software in 2016 (acquired by Synopsys), he has also served as Research Director at SAP. He received a PhD in Computing Science from the University of Alberta and won several awards including NSERC (Canada) scholar in 2005 and Global Young Scientist (Singapore). He concurrently holds Adjunct Professor positions at the University of British Columbia, University of Victoria and University of Northern BC.</p> <p>Abstract : \u201cA Workshop on Zero Trust and API Risk Management\u201d</p> <p>Web applications have revolutionized our digital world. 96% of such web applications are built using some Open Source [Black Duck]. Furthermore, 99% of such Open Source based applications contain some Web APIs [TeejLab]. It\u2019s not surprising that Akamai estimated that 83% of the internet traffic today is via Web APIs that connect digital applications at a global scale. The growing API usage impacts organizations both positively (through innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, etc.) and negatively (due to security vulnerabilities, business disruptions, legal and compliance issues etc.). Gartner has predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at enterprises, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs by managing API risks proactively. This workshop will provide an overview of an API Governance framework to manage API security and legal risks. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can adopt for effective API Risk Management. We\u2019ll highlight best practices, both manual and automated, with relevant hands-on examples and scenarios.</p> <p>Provisional Agenda</p> <p>17:30 - Webinar waiting lobby opens<br/>18:40 - Presentation followed by Questions and Answers<br/>19:30 - Closing</p> "

Extensive use is made of open source software such as libraries and frameworks. While this is fantastic from a development point of view (allowing for faster development of applications and features), it does present a potential drawback if not done correctly, an increased risk. Often, we see libraries being used and seldom updated, also we see several libraries being blindly with little to not inspections and reviews. This is gold mine for attackers, there are many ways that they have will continue to use this to their advantage. The purpose of this talk is to cover some of the techniques which attackers could use to exploit open source supply chains. This will include a live demonstration of one such technique which an attacker could used. The talk will then focus on the excellent OWASP Dependency Track tool, showing how this can help reduce the risk to organizations when it comes to dealing with open source packages in software.</p> <p>BIO: Sean Wright is the Lead Application Security SME at Immersive Labs with an origin as a software developer. Primarily focused on web-based application security with a special interest in TLS related subjects. Experienced in providing technical leadership in relation to application security, as well as engaging with teams to improve the security of systems that they develop. Passionate to be a part of the community and giving back to the community. Additionally, enjoy spending personal time performing personal security-related research.</p> <p>Meeting info will be visible to you only if you RSVP for the meeting.</p> <p>ATTENTION SPONSORS: YOUR NAME COULD BE HERE<br/>Check out sponsorship opportunities here<br/><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-los-angeles-chapter-meeting-sponsorship-tickets-30572600471\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-los-angeles-chapter-meeting-sponsorship-tickets-30572600471</a></p> "

Unlike other methods this works on phones out of the box, so you won't need ADB access to your locked phone, or to have previously rooted the Operating System. While not every phone is vulnerable, many are, and the version of Android doesn't matter. Although Android itself is reasonable secure, each handset manufacturer has made their own lock-screen with custom brute-force protection and some of them are easily cracked.</p> <p>Bio<br/>[[ Andrew Horton ]]<br/>Andrew Horton aka urbanadventurer has been in the information security space for over 10 years.

If you are launching a microservice into a Kubernetes cluster, or even building an entire AWS virtual infrastructure, IaC can automate the deployment. By building repeatable templates you can also ensure that deployments happen exactly as you design, every time. However, errors in infrastructure configuration are now regarded as the second biggest cause of data breaches. There are many ways to give adversaries an advantage through security misconfigurations. Overly permissive storage volumes, unauthenticated database access, or ports left open to the internet have all been a cause of compromise. The solution? Treat your infrastructure code the same as your application code. During your build process, use tools to scan for infrastructure misconfigurations. When you find them raise alerts or even break the build.</p> <p>In this session, we will discuss common types of IaC misconfigurations, and demonstrate a free, open-source security tool that developers can build into their pipelines to help protect infrastructure from compromise.</p> <p>About Ori Bendet:</p> <p>An experienced product leader combining strong technical and marketing skills, Ori has been leading Checkmarx's flagship product, CxSAST (Static Application Security Testing), a Gartner and Forrester market-leading solution, serving thousands of customers worldwide for the last 2 years.

He's an open so(u)rcerer and has built or contributed to a wide variety of security tools, both offensive and defensive. This talk is discussing both positive and negative phenomenom around a web fuzzing tool he built and maintains: ffuf, or: \"fuzz faster u fool\".</p> <p>~*FFUF - Fuzz Faster, U're ***ed ... The good, the bad and the ugly of web fuzzing~<br/>Abstract: Web fuzzing is a powerful method for automating the boring tasks in both black box, and gray box testing of web applications. There's only so much one can do when approaching this kind of target manually but with proper tooling the server resources are the only limit. Wait? Server resources being the limit?</p> <p>Penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, security researchers and criminals are using the same techniques for different purposes. What happens when you are able to send tens of thousands of requests from your laptop, over the internet to a target. What if you scale it up horizontally, doing the same thing from hundreds of sources? What if the responding endpoint is intentionally slow - a login for example?</p> <p>At the cloud-native age, rate limiting might seem as an ancient thing from a distant past but for the very same reasons it's more relevant than ever...</p> "

Aside from offensive security practices, Ignatius has also led numerous cyber maturity assessment engagements, architecture review, and is currently an instructor at Seneca College.</p> <p>TALK<br/>-------</p> <p>Software Composition Analysis 101: Knowing what\u2019s inside your apps</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>The term Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is relatively new to the security world. However, similar approaches have been used since the early 2000s to indicate security verifications on open source components. SCA has become an evolution of that. It is the process of identifying and listing all the components and versions present in the code and checking each specific service and looking for outdated or vulnerable libraries that may impose security risks to the application. These tools can also check for legal issues regarding the use of open-source software with different licensing terms and conditions. Nevertheless, how those SCA tools work, and how can they help identify and remediate issues on open source libraries used in a codebase? This talk aims to focus on and explain to the audience by showing how these tools work and the main pieces of information that these tools rely on, such as the application manifest, vulnerability data sources, and dependency metadata.</p> <p>Audience Takeaways<br/>SCA tools and techniques are here to stay, and their usage is increasing in many organizations where security is a priority. Unfortunately, AppSec teams cannot keep up with all the new vulnerabilities published daily. Make sure to look for solutions that can adequately adapt to your own way of building software. They need to cover the programming languages used in your organization and identify issues on indirect dependencies, not just relying on public CVEs to find those issues.</p> <p>Presenter:</p> <p>Magno Logan works as an Information Security Specialist for Trend Micro. He specializes in Cloud, Container and Application Security Research, Threat Modelling and Red Teaming. He has been tapped as a resource speaker for numerous security conferences around the globe. He is also a member of the CNCF SIG-Security team</p> "

        "description": "<p>For the last meetup of the year, we are bringing in one of the OWASP titans to talk about OWASP's latest update on their Top 10 and afterwards we will have a casual conversation on the Top 10.</p> <p>OWASP Top 10 2021 Release (6:00-7:00pm)<br/>By: Jim Manico</p> <p>Jim Manico is one of the co-authors of the OWASP Top 10 2021, the Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) and the OWASP Cheatsheets. Many of you already know of him, he is a legend in the Application Security industry.</p> <p>The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for web developers and web application security professionals. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. Companies should adopt this document and start the process of ensuring that their web applications minimize these risks. Using the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps the most effective first step towards changing the software development culture within your organization into one that produces more secure code.</p> <p>The OWASP Top Ten 2021 includes:<br/>- A01:2021-Broken Access Control<br/>- A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures<br/>- A03:2021-Injection<br/>- A04:2021-Insecure Design<br/>- A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration<br/>- A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components<br/>- A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures<br/>- A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures<br/>- A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failure<br/>- A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Jim Manico is the founder of Manicode Security where he trains software developers on secure coding and security engineering. He is also an investor/advisor for Nucleus Security, BitDiscovery, Secure Circle, KSOC and Inspectiv. Jim is a frequent speaker on secure software practices, is a member of the Java Champion community, and is the author of \"Iron-Clad Java: Building Secure Web Applications\" from Oracle Press.

Security professionals commonly perform it, but anyone can do threat modelling. This hands-on workshop will cover the threat modelling workflow, common classes of vulnerabilities, and hands-on examples that will have *you* discover threats in different systems. Threat Modelling is an integral part of every company\u2019s Security Development Lifecycle. Still, as development teams grow more prominent, security will have to choose which features they want to Threat Model, or they will become a bottleneck for the development organization.</p> <p>Speaker Biography:</p> <p>Jeevan Singh is an Application Security Engineering Manager for Twilio Segment (<a href=\"https://segment.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://segment.com</a>), where he is embedding security into all aspects of the software development process.

Teams are adopting it very fast, but rarely with enough time to really understand how it works and what are all the right ways to configure and work with K8s. And lacking the knowledge in k8s can of course lead to various misconfigurations and security issues in k8s clusters. So in this episode, we will see some of the easy and practical ways to make sure we configure and run secure clusters.</p> <p>NANA JANASHIA<br/>Nana is a DevOps engineer and trainer. She started the Techworld with Nana channel to share her expertise about various DevOps topics and to help DevOps enthusiasts get into the field easier and with more motivation. Through her channel and different courses, she has reached millions of people. Her passion is to explain complex topics easily so that everyone understands them. She consults teams of developers to help them improve their existing processes for CI/CD, containerization and orchestration.</p> "
