While extensions can be very useful, they come with hidden dangers \u2013 users often prioritise functionality over safety. In this talk, you'll uncover the real risks of using extensions, explore common attacks, and learn about pitfalls. You'll also take a look at some real-life security incidents and what went wrong. You'll leave with a deeper understanding of the need for browser extension security and how to safeguard your browser.\n\n**Bio:** Billy Sheppard is a Bristol-based Senior Application Security Engineer working at Immersive Labs where he creates Secure Code content and challenges for their product.\n\nIn his career thus far, he has earned several achievements including VDP submissions for Fortune 500 companies, Bug bounties, and created and released his own niche CTF/Hacking challenge specifically aimed at increasing security awareness for ServiceNow developers. He has also created a Web Security YouTube Channel to demonstrate security concepts and educate developers and reported multiple real security issues to VDPs/Bug Bounty Programs for large companies such as BBC, RedHat and Accenture. He is a keen learner and spends a lot of his personal time continuously learning and is passionate about education around secure code.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nTalk 2: **An Introduction to scripting for Application Testers,** presented by **Alex Archondakis**.\n\n**Abstract**: Scripting, or the ability to write code that allows you to perform actions or automate repetitive tasks is a crucial tool in any application security testers belt, however, it doesn\u2019t seem to be a common one.\n\nThe purpose of this talk is to introduce scripting to application security testers, this will be achieved by looking at case studies to determine where scripting may be appropriate and how to solve the problem. We will discuss multiple languages and their advantages whilst focussing on interacting with the HTTP protocol.\n\nThe key learning points from this talk are as follows:\n\n* To gain an understanding of the importance of scripting for application security testers\n* What programming languages are used, and their advantages/disadvantages.\n* Typical scenarios where scripting is required because tooling is not comprehensive enough\n\n**Bio**: Alex is head of professional services & a senior consultant at Pentest People. He has a wealth of experience in penetration testing, people management and training hackers. He believes that all application security professionals should be able to write basic scripts to solve common problems."

We explain a bit about what we have been doing the last few years, what we have found and why we no longer can see pentests, risk-assessments, redteaming or just plain old SMA's as adequate for understanding and securing OT environments or critical infrastructure.\n**The team** consists of Ove Tj\u00f6rnhed, Anastasiya Kornitska, and Oscar Gumaelius. They started working together at Orange Cyberdefence where they built OCD's OT Security field in Sweden from the ground up. Now they are working as a team at Afry X to create and build a OT Security area and help design secure OT environments and help spread the knowledge of OT security.\n\n**19:15 - 20:15: Make the cracker pay. Moving password hashing to the client.**\nOne of the main targets of attackers is exfiltrating the user databases and their password verifiers. Attackers will then try to guess the passwords doing guesses against the verifiers so that they can then try to access other services where the user may have used the same, or similar, credentials. To slow down attackers, password hashing algorithms exist which need huge amounts of memory space and bandwidth along with large processing times. Unfortunately, such algorithms are used commonly on the server to which the clients authenticate making them unusable on many systems and opening the system to Denial of Service attacks. To address this, we can instead require the client (or attacker) to perform the hashing themselves, but how can we do it without introducing new security issues? In this talk he will explain how to modify password based flows to move the brunt of the work away from the server in a secure way. We will also introduce a few techniques to improve the performance of the flows without reducing the security and introduce Clipaha, an open source library providing client-side password hashing which can be helpful in this process.\n**Francisco Blas Izquierdo Riera** **(klondike)** is studying his PhD at Chalmers with sponsoring from MSB through the Resilient IoT project. In his PhD studies, he is trying to use his knowledge of real world problems learned after years of experience working as a pentester and as a CISO to create useful solutions to address them. He is also active doing CTFs as part of ChaGU.\n**20:15 - 21:30:** Over-time (optional)\nHang out, grab something to drink, and discuss security, the weather or anything in between!\n\n[Get tickets to the event!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-goteborg-summer-security-evening-tickets-631496782877?aff=ebdshpsearchautocomplete&keep_tld=1)"

He was a member of the OWASP Global Conferences committee and lead the organization of 3 OWASP AppSec conferences in Brazil.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferreira/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferreira/)\nTwitter: @lucassapao\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nTitle: **One-Time Quantum-Resistant Fully-Homomorphic Padding Oracle cryptography trends, buzzwords, and snake oil for 2023**\n\nSpeaker:\nDiogo Sousa\n\nAbstract:\nIn our modern times, cryptography is all around us, even if we don't notice it. We use it when checking our bank statements, buying pig plushies online, or sending stickers to each other on instant messengers. Given its ubiquity, it is, for the most part, taken for granted by developers: import HTTP/crypto/TLS, throw in a certificate from Let's Encrypt, and don't think much about it while relying on (hopefully) safe defaults.\nWhile sticking with well-vetted libraries should work out of the box for most cases, in certain areas, you need to be a bit more knowledgeable, if only to make good decisions about what libraries to use and how to wrangle all the moving parts into a cohesive and secure system.\nCryptography tends to be full of obscure notation that isn't that dissimilar to magic spells, and \"Don't Roll Your Own Crypto\" is an often repeated mantra (many times because of the previous statement). Search results for \"crypto\" have been getting progressively more complicated to navigate, with BTC, XRP, and others taking up all the prime SEO result space.\nThis talk targets a beginner to an intermediate audience and, starting from a brief overview of core tenets (Kerckhoffs's principle, Schneier's Law, the economy of mechanism, theoretical vs. practical security), will expand upon the current challenges and trends in modern cryptography, from FHE to PQC (including explaining what those are), and also highlight common design pitfalls (and their consequences) and how to reduce your snake oil intake.\n\nBio:\nAn opinionated individual with interest in cryptography and its intersection with secure software development.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xdsousa/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xdsousa/)"

These costs are the result of misconfiguration in infrastructure and workloads. One way to proactively identify misconfiguration is through security scanning. The scan results provide us with insights into the security posture of our services over time. However, these scanners treat our resources as static and evaluate misconfiguration only in single instances. To assess the potential impact of misconfiguration in our production environment, we need additional tools. In this talk, we will look at ways Chaos Engineering and Security Experimentation can help us minimise the potential damage of misconfiguration. Chaos Engineering is the process of intentionally introducing fault into a system to test its resilience to failure. Anais will walk you through the principles of Security Chaos Engineering and how it can be used to proactively identify misconfiguration and make our deployment pipeline and services more robust.\n\n**Talk 2: \"It\u2019s Not a Bug It\u2019s Emergent Behaviour - Generative AI, Its Cybersecurity Risks and Benefits\" - Sherif Mansour**\n\nA curated talk on generative AI, where Sherif will present his research findings beginning with an overview of the technology, then discuss its current technical risks, and explore its promising security use cases without making grand claims. Additionally, this talk dive into design considerations when developing web applications utilising generative AI. To conclude, Sherif will introduce open-source software announced during the talk, encouraging attendees to use and investigate them at their own discretion.\n\n**SPEAKERS:**\n\n**Ana\u00efs Urlichs (@urlichsanais)**\n\nAna\u00efs Urlichs is a Developer Advocate at Aqua Security, where she contributes to Aqua\u2019s cloud native open source projects. When she is not advocating DevOps best practices, she runs her own YouTube Channel centered around cloud native technologies. Before joining Aqua, Anais worked as SRE at Civo, a cloud native service provider, where she worked on infrastructure for hundreds of tenant clusters. As OpenUK ambassador, her passion lies in making tools and platforms more accessible to developers and community members.\n\n**Sherif Mansour (@kerberosmansour)**\n\nSherif Mansour is the global director of information security at JustEat Takeaway.com and has been working in the field of information security for 19 years. He was the OWASP chairman and sat on of the OWASP foundations' board for four years. He was also one of the founding governing board members for the OpenSSF Foundation which he represented the OWASP Foundation. Sherif contributed to several OWASP projects and was one the main authors of the CIS Benchmark for Tomcat 7/8.

And, by all means, let\u2019s learn how to be a bit lazy, and do better with less effort!\n*Bio:*\nCurrently working as Information Security Manager at Canon EMEA, Sebastian has been in IT and Security for over 20 years, covering a multitude of roles ranging from Developer, Security Architect, Auditor and Consultant, before moving into security governance and management, giving him a unique multi-faceted view on today\u2019s InfoSec challenges. He has led multiple security improvement programs and performed maturity assessments for a wide variety of organizations - while continuously asking himself:\"Could we do this in another way?\"\n\n**About containers and their escapes: understanding escape patterns and possibilities**\n*Abstract:*\nContainers have become one of the most common underlying infrastructure for microservice architectures. As such, they can often be part of the external attack surface of enterprise systems and applications (e.g., whenever a web application hosted on a kubernetes cluster is Internet-facing). Thus, it is important to understand what types of (mis)configurations can make containers more vulnerable against attacks of different types. In this talk, Mauricio will deep dive into different techniques that can be used to escape containers. In particular, he will talk about how to escape privileged containers, the usage of different capabilities, the usage of kernel exploits and a few other ways in which attackers may use to gain access to the hosts of the containers.\n*Bio:*\nMauricio Cano is a cloud pentester focused on container technologies. In particular, he focuses on the security of containers and serverless architectures. He has pentested Kubernetes clusters and serverless architectures for several multinational financial institutions. Prior to his security work, he has a background in academia and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Groningen, focused on programming language design and formal methods to ensure correctness. In his spare time, Cano enjoys reading, cooking, and solving puzzles."

One strategy that has proven to be highly effective is application modernization. This is not just a mere upgrade; it is a complete transformation of how businesses operate. By embracing this approach, companies can accelerate innovation, optimize costs, and improve their overall security posture.\n\nHowever, embarking on the journey of application modernization is not an easy task. It requires a significant investment in people, processes, and technology to achieve the desired business outcomes. The right foundation must be established from the beginning to avoid the high cost of re-architecture, which can be a major roadblock in achieving success. One crucial aspect is developing a standard and scalable security design for their Kubernetes environment. This will establish the framework for implementing the necessary checks, enforcement, and visibility to enable strategic business objectives.\n\nIn conclusion, application modernization is a strategic initiative that can transform businesses. Developing a standard and scalable security design for the Kubernetes environment is critical to establishing the framework for implementing the necessary checks, enforcement, and visibility to enable strategic business objectives.\n\n**Presenter:**\n\n**Regis Martins**\n\nRegis Martins is a passionate problem solver and technologist with a deep-rooted love for finding innovative solutions. With a background in Electrical Engineering and a Master's Degree in Computer Science, he has honed his expertise in areas such as deep packet inspection technologies, traffic management, network analytics, and Kubernetes. His journey has led him to excel as a Sales Engineer, where he architects solutions, educates clients, and thrives in helping organizations overcome challenges.
