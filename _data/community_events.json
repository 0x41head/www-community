Our idolization of hackers, penetration testing and \u2018breaking\u2019 has not resulted in secure software for our industry, only egos, stereotypes and unaffordable security models. Modern application security approaches need to address both offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) approaches, as well as continuous learning and advocacy for developers. This means Purple Team. This talk will explore how to combine defence, offence, automation, empathy and continuous learning, all without the requirement of ever wearing a hoodie.

In this event we hope to cement that knowledge by showing you the view from the other side of the fence.\nIn this live interactive demonstration we will show you what a web target looks like from the perspective of an attacker. With the use of a vulnerable target that has not followed security best practices we will show you just how easy it is for an attacker to gain access to your computer, it's data and resources. With each step of the attack we will demonstrate techniques and tools while discussing what could of been done to mitigate each step of the attack.\nBy thinking like a Hacker and seeing your \"defences\" from their point of view we hope to show you how important following cyber security best practices really is.\nAttendees of the OWASP Suffolk Fight Club events will be familiar with the format of this event, except that this will be scripted with interactive Q&A. The vulnerable target will be a virtual machine created for the purpose of learning.\nAgenda:\n\n* OWASP updates\n* Live interactive demonstration of a web attack with Q&A throughout\n\nDisclaimer: As always our events are designed to educate.

Further details can be found below.\n\nThere will be refreshments available on the night.\n\n**Speaker One:** Gavin O'Gorman - Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) & The war in Ukraine\n\nGavin is a principal intelligence analyst in the Signals team, a part of Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC). His current role is to work with intelligence analysts in MSTIC, and engineers on the Signals team, to help build systems and automation that enable analysts to track more malicious actors, faster. Prior to working in Microsoft, Gavin spent 13 years in Symantec, working as a reverse engineer, incident handler, intelligence analyst and manager of the Attack Investigations Team. He has tracked and authored reports on actors operating across the world, including both government and corporate espionage, and e-crime. Gavin also lectures the Advanced Malware course in UCD's MSc in Forensic Computing and Cybercrime.\"\n\n**Topic: MSTIC & The war in Ukraine**\n\nPrior to and during the war in Ukraine, MSTIC tracked multiple Russian actors engaging in offensive cyber operations against Ukraine. MSTIC has attributed these actors back to Russian entities such as the SVR, GRU and FSB.\nIn this talk, we'll review the types of attacks that MSTIC identified being performed against Ukraine. How does one identify the right person to prevent a cyber attack against an organisation physically located in an active warzone? We'll show how Microsoft worked with Ukrainian individuals and organisations to help mitigate attacks, including techniques that Microsoft would apply for the first time.\n\n**Speaker Two:** Oliver Ciappara- Automating Malware Analysis\n\nOliver is a Senior Malware Analysis Developer at Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC). Oliver's primary focus is to automate and streamline file analysis within Microsoft.\n\nThe tools that Oliver is putting in place enable rapid analysis and triage of malware. This rapid analysis allows threat intelligence teams to track actor activity by extracting relevant indicators and context, as well as help protect Microsoft's customers.\n\nBefore joining Microsoft, Oliver developed software for embedded systems as well as cybersecurity products. Having recently completed a Master's in Law from UCC, specialising in Cybercrime and E-Law, he has a unique combination of technical and legal expertise.\"\n\n**Topic: Automating Malware Analysis**\n\nDiscover the power of Automated Malware Analysis with Assemblyline. Developed by the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, Assemblyline is a cutting-edge open-source solution for automating malware analysis. With its modular and scalable architecture, Assemblyline efficiently processes and aggregates information from various analysers, while also centralizing analysis tools used by different teams. Automated malware analysis lowers the bar and enables TIs to continue their work as quickly as possible, while also freeing up REs to do the more important work. Join us and get a first-hand look at assemblyline and its capabilities.\n\n**Thank you to our speakers for the evening and also to Workday for hosting us. Without the support of the community we would not be able to run these meetups.**"

I\u2019m passionate about software security. The niche I am currently working on is engineering processes, tools, and internal interfaces to help companies secure their development lifecycles, do vulnerability management and increase overall awareness of the product's security risks.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nTitle: **Is it private, is it public? Dependency Confusion**\n\nSpeaker:\nFrancisco Santos\n\nAbstract:\nBy 2021, the number of components in the average application rose 77 % from 298 to more than 500 open-source packages. Those components are hosted on public repositories such as GitHub, NPM, or PyPI, while some organizations choose to operate proprietary packages inside private registries of those repositories. Private or public, the management is done by CLI (like npm). The CLI imports private or public packages via a simple precedence algorithm: If the package resides inside the private registry, import it. If not, import the public component. How can a bad actor play this to his advantage?\nThe \"is it private, is it public? Dependency Confusion\" talk explains what dependency confusion is, and teaches ways of finding dependency confusion vulnerabilities in js files via BurpSuite with an automated tool called jsminer, a real example of a dependency confusion bug I found, and recommendations to mitigate those issues. By the end, breakers and makers should acquire a fresh new perspective on this issue.\n\n[Francisco Santos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-santos-77917a210/) Bio:\nI'm Francisco Santos, 23 years old. I always liked to think out of the box and find weird solutions to problems. I like logic and solving puzzles. I enjoy being a breaker, and I want to add value to that community.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/andr0idp4r4n0id"

Throughout the entire development of an open source project, security needs to be top of mind due to a potential myriad threats. Some open source orgs are starting to ask for security matrices, and expect some threat modelling to have taken place, so that the threats of a system can be evaluated. This however, can be difficult. Considering the different use cases of a project that may be running in different architectures can be quite a struggle, combined with sometimes working with developers that may not be familiar with threat modelling in general. This talk will explore how to make threat modelling easier for open source developers through using open source tools such as OWASP Threat Dragon and Threagile, and where each is better suited than the other.\n\n**Talk 2: An AppSec Point of View On Synthetic Identities, Timur Yunusov**\nIn the era of neobanks with no branches and broadly adopted eKYC standards, the entry barriers for cybercriminals are extremely low. How could FinTech win in this ongoing cat-and-mouse game? How criminals utilise gaps in workflows of the modern payment ecosystem? After looking at mobile applications and the API workflows of dozens of FinTech companies across Europe, the USA and Asia, I will provide real-world examples from both sides of the battle.\n\n**SPEAKERS**\n\n**Mike Andrews(@ma)**\nMike is Chief Architect and First Engineer at Open Raven. Mike is a true industry veteran - his previous roles include: Engineering Manager for Microsoft Azure storage, Co-founder of the Azure SRE team, Director of Engineering for Microsoft Strategic engagement team and Bing Security Strategist. Architect at McAfee and consultant at Foundstone. Mike has a PhD in computer science from University of Kent and is an assistant professor at Florida Institute of Technology. Roadie for stadium rock bands in the 90s.\n\n**Dan Conn (@danjconn)**\nDan Conn likes to sit in the point between cyber security and development and over the past 10 years has worked as a developer in small startups, large corporates and many in between, catering for clients both public and private sector from SME size to enterprise. He has also had a strong interest in cybersecurity for just as long culminating in a postgraduate certificate in Advanced Security and Digital Forensics. Dan is now a Developer Advocate for Sonatype. When not coding, hacking, or talking about these things\u2026 you can find Dan running, skateboarding, DJ-ing or making music!\n\n**Timur Yunusov (@a66ot)**\nTimur Yunusov, Payment security researcher, an application security expert with a focus on FinTech, and one of the Payment Village organisers. Some of Timur's research in the field of application security includes \"Bruteforce of PHPSESSID\" and \"XML Out-Of-Band\" shown at the Black Hat EU back in 2013 . Timur has previously spoken at conferences such as Black Hat EU, BlackHat USA, HackInTheBox, Nullcon, NoSuchCon, CanSecWest, Hack In Paris, ZeroNights, Positive Hack Days and at OWASP meetups.\n\n**TICKETS**\nThis event is free to attend for both members and non-members of OWASP and is open to anyone interested in web application and cyber security.

API security poses unique challenges to builders and defenders, and many of your existing detection and protection measures may prove to be ineffective.\n\nJoin Colin as he draws on his experience from curating the industry's biggest API security resource (APISecurity.io) in exploring the following:\nCrash course on the OWASP API Security Top 10 (and how it differs from the OWASP Top 10)\nA whistle-stop tour of some of the biggest API breaches over the past 18 months, taking a look at what went wrong, the impact, and most importantly, how to prevent such attacks.\nFinally, he will present the top techniques for protecting your APIs from attack, starting with secure development practices through to API protection and threat detection.\n\nThe content will be technical, with demos and code samples, and based on real-world breaches. By the end of the session, you will have an understanding of the API Security Top 10, and have a working knowledge of how to protect your APIs, either at a code level or using runtime protections.\n*Bio:*\nColin has a long and varied career in producing secure, rugged, and trustable software and hardware products covering a range of industries from military, consumer, medical, automotive to financial services. In the last decade, he has become a sought-after evangelist and consultant in building AppSec programs, and the latest developments in DevSecOps. His greatest passion is for teaching and inspiring others to produce software we can trust, either delivering webinars, in-person events or speaking to the C-level.\n\nCurrently, he is the Chief Technology Evangelist with 42Crunch, the curator of the APISecurity.io newsletter, and is writing the industry\u2019s first book on defending APIs.\n\n**Managing APIs securely**\n*Abstract:*\nWhen an organization offers an API, the API needs to become a Managed API. This means that lifecycle management, security, and throttling resources become an important aspect of API Management, as well as the ability of developers to find, explore and subscribe to the API to use them.\n\nDuring the presentation, Rob will zoom into these aspects and how an API Manager can help you with security and throttling (including schema validation and advanced scenarios) while at the same time making the API easily available to your target developers (inside or outside the organization).\n\nIn the second part, he will elaborate on the \u201cshiny frontend / dirty backend\u201d. This is an API frontend that accesses legacy systems, databases, but also the integration of a set of APIs etc., thus enabling services that use older technology or proprietary interfaces to have a modern appearance to the outside world, e.g. exposing a legacy insurance policy administration system as an API.\n\nThirdly, we will look at the way you can implement the Mastodon API. Since Elon Musk acquired Twitter l ast year, alternative platforms like Mastodon have become more popular. It might be that this becomes a viable channel to communicate with clients for some organizations.\n*Bio:*\nRob has 30 years of experience in IT in such roles as developer, analyst, project manager, business consultant, and management consultant. He is currently Head of Training Services and Integration Consultant at Yenlo, responsible for the development and the actual training of Yenlo\u2019s clients and consultants.\n\nNext to these responsibilities, Rob is also an avid blogger with almost 200 blogs on innovation on Frankwatching, more than 150 blogs on WSO2 on Yenlo\u2019s website and many other blogs on various other sites. Rob is also a regular contributor to BNR Zaken Doen radio show on the area of technology and innovation.\n\n**Delegates may be asked to provide a valid proof of photo ID (such as a driving licence or passport) to enter the venue.**"

CTF's usually come in two varieties:\n\n* **Jeopardy**: *is a type of cybersecurity competition. In a CTF, participants work to solve challenges that are often based on real-world scenarios, such as finding vulnerabilities in systems or decoding hidden messages. These challenges are usually organized into categories, such as web security, cryptography, or binary exploitation, and participants earn points for each challenge they successfully solve. CTFs are often used as a way for cybersecurity professionals to learn and improve their skills, and they can also be a lot of fun for people who are interested in this field.*\n\n* **Attack & Defense**: *Attack-Defense CTFs are a type of cybersecurity competition where teams are given a set of resources, such as servers or websites, and must defend them from attacks launched by other teams. At the same time, each team must also try to attack and compromise the resources of the other teams. In this type of CTF, points are usually awarded for successfully launching an attack or successfully defending against an attack.*\n\nWe want to be able to live stream the event, so stay tuned into all of OWASP San Juans social media. If you'd like to help promote, sponsor, donate, develop, or collaborate, please checkout our home page where to go!\n\nTo learn more, reach out to a community member, and we hope to see you there at the event!"

As a result, several Swedish websites were affected, but thankfully not nation-critical services.\n\nDDoS attacks are on the rise on a global scale. They are used by organized crime to blackmail organizations, as well as nation state actors to attack infrastructure of other countries, often opportunistically under the cover of political events.\n\nFor this event we get together to discuss what happened, but more importantly what we can do to protect the organizations we work for against DDoS attacks.\n\nThe event will be held using huddle in Slack so make sure to join the channel \u201cchapter-stockholm\u201d."

With the use of a vulnerable target that has not followed security best practices we will show you just how easy it is for an attacker to gain access to your computer, it's data and resources. With each step of the attack we will demonstrate techniques and tools while discussing what could of been done to mitigate each step of the attack.\n\nBy thinking like a Hacker and seeing your \"defences\" from their point of view we hope to show you how important following cyber security best practices really is.\n\nAttendees of the OWASP Suffolk Fight Club events will be familiar with the format of this event, except that this will be scripted with interactive Q&A. The vulnerable target will be a virtual machine created for the purpose of learning.\n\nAgenda:\n\n* OWASP updates\n* Live interactive demonstration of a web attack with Q&A throughout\n\nDisclaimer: As always our events are designed to educate.

The ideal established flow says that if we changed even a single character in our JWT, the request should not pass through, which it doesn't. But it passes through if the change is done at a specific position in the token.\n\nConceptually it appears to be a valid test case because it's a tampering of the token. But the catch is it's not valid test case, and this talk is about that why this is not a valid test case.\n\n**Where:** https://us06web.zoom.us/j/87352968700?pwd=YmE0cWdhQWNxNmo4cEZrbHpidmlhdz09"
