Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs.</p> <p>You may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues.</p> <p>Gartner has actually predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks.</p> <p>This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks. We\u2019ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management .</p> "

Tooling and training can solve the most common issues, but what about the human scaling side of things?</p> <p>This is one question that most of us don't have a great answer to, A security champion program could be the answer you are looking for; to scale the right way and build a security culture.</p> <p>Special guest Abhijeth Dugginapeddi will share his experiences in running the Security Champion program in two large companies and the lessons he has learnt from them.</p> <p>Abhijeth Dugginapeddi is the Head of AppSec, Adjunct Professor, and Mentor. He is a security enthusiast in the fields of Penetration Testing and Application/Mobile/Infrastructure Security. He believes in the need for more security awareness and free responsible disclosures. He has found a few vulnerabilities with Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft, eBay, Dropbox, etc. He has previously presented at Defcon, Blackhat, OWASP AppSec USA, c0c0n, Secure-2018 Poland, CISO Summit, and several other events.</p> "

It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. Companies should adopt this document and start the process of ensuring that their web applications minimize these risks.
