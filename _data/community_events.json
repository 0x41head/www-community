        "description": "Our April Meetup is hosted by Check Point at their San Carlos location.\n\nPlease note: You will be required to show picture ID to enter the building.\n\n**Location**\nCheck Point Software Technologies 959 Skyway Rd #300, San Carlos, CA 94070\n\n**Agenda**\n5:30 - Doors open\n5:30 - 6:00 Food and drinks, networking\n6:00 - 6:45 Ryan Rasmuss - Leveraging ML/AI to advance Application Security\n6:45 - 7:30 Kiran Kamit - Reducing Alert Fatigue with Container Scans: Correlate, Prioritize and Filter Based on Usage\n7:30 - 8:15 Jim Downey - topic TBA\n8:15 - Close\n\n**We will have three talks this month**\n\n**Talk 1:**\n*Leveraging ML/AI to advance Application Security*\n\nDescription:\nWeb Applications and APIs are always vulnerable to new CVEs and victim to constant probing of threat actors. When a new vulnerability is released, we have to identify if our application is susceptible and then build a rule(s) to protect against these exploits. Pair this with applications and APIs that change with every release and we are left feeling uncertain.\n\nIn today's session we will deploy open source tools that leverage machine learning for web applications and APIs. These tools will help us learn about our applications and automatically apply the relevant protections. We can also learn about new exploits in the wild before an official CVE is released.\n\nSpeaker:\nRyan Rasmuss has been working as a security engineer for Check Point Software Ltd for about 5 years. During that time he\u2019s focused on Application Security and Threat Intelligence. Outside of work he\u2019s a big fan of local CTFs, golf, and camping!\n\n**Talk 2:**\n*Reducing Alert Fatigue with Container Scans: Correlate, Prioritize and Filter Based on Usage*\n\nDescription:\nToday, developers and devops engineers are being asked to address vulnerabilities and apply chain risks in container images. However, the volume of noisy security alerts often leads to developers ignoring them entirely or wasting valuable sprint time researching \u201cfalse positives.\u201d\nThis session will focus on how engineering teams can correlate vulnerabilities with runtime information, prioritize alerts based on usage, and filter out false positives that don\u2019t represent a true exposure of a vulnerability. Prioritizing security updates to only used packages in your container image is a highly effective approach to reducing alert fatigue with your container scans. In addition, your DevOps team can even consider removing some of the unused packages and shrink your container images. As an example, this session will include a demonstration of a typical SCA static container scan of a sample open-source test application and then show how an engineering team can filter alerts to reduce the number of vulnerable and used alerts that actually need to be fixed by developers by up to 90%.\n\nSpeaker:\nKiran Kamity is the Founder & CEO of Deepfactor. He is a serial Silicon Valley entrepreneur with a passion for building products that meet a need and make a business impact\u2014with Deepfactor that\u2019s empowering engineering teams to create secure cloud native applications. Prior to Deepfactor, Kiran was the Head of Product at Cisco Cloud BU, Founder/CEO at ContainerX (acquired by Cisco), and the Founder/VP at RingCube (acquired by Citrix). Kiran is a TEDx speaker and loves nature, travel, and food\n\n**Talk 3:**\n*Details to follow*"

        "description": "Hi all, for our last OWASP Frankfurt Chapter event before the upcoming [German OWASP Day 2023](https://god.owasp.de/2023/) edition, join us for our **Women in AppSec Special**, where we'll be tackling two of the most pressing topics in the industry today: enhancing security culture through security champions, and offensive security beyond the checkbox. There will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event at the venue.\n\n_What's going to happen?\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our OWASP Frankfurt Meetup hosted by **CHECK24 Frankfurt.**\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n* _Talk 1 - \\*\"\\***Enhancing security culture through security champions**\" by **Diana Waithanji**, Cybersecurity engineer at SAP.\nAs software development becomes increasingly fast-paced, the need for secure development practices has never been more urgent. Enter the security champion - an individual who advocates for security within their team and takes ownership of all security issues. In this talk, Diana will delve into the principles of success in advocacy through security champions, and explore methods for training software developers to become security champions themselves. Drawing on real-world examples, Diana will also showcase a partnership model in AppSec that has proven to be effective in enhancing security culture within development teams. If you want to learn how to foster a culture of secure development in your team, this talk is not to be missed!\n\n* _Talk 2 - \"**Beyond the Checkbox: Breaking out of Testing Frameworks**\" by **Jiska Classen**, As mobile applications handle sensitive data, ensuring their security is crucial. However, simply securing individual apps is not enough to stop real-world attackers who exploit devices through other avenues. This talk will explore unconventional security testing approaches that can help improve app security by addressing vulnerabilities in the operating system, hardware, and third-party libraries. Discover how attackers can exploit wireless interfaces, sandboxing, privilege checking bypasses, and more. Let's explore why these attack vectors are relevant in practice and how to address them beyond standard security testing checklists.\n\n_Afterwards? We will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility to **socialize** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **CHECK24 Frankfurt**.\n\n_When\nOur Meetup takes place on the last Wednesday of the month in April, namely on 26.04.2023 from 18:00 to 21.00 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nCHECK24 Frankfurt is located at Speicherstra\u00dfe 55 in Frankfurt am Main, ca. 15min within walking distance of Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nGet in touch with the Frankfurt Chapter Leads (Dan Gora or Jonas Becker)\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"

Not only are two major releases in the pipeline (5.0 and 2.0 respectively) but we are now seeing industry stand up, take notice and start expecting more from applications, based on these standards. In this talk, Josh Grossman (one of the ASVS project leaders) will take you through these key developments including our vision for the upcoming version 5.0 of the ASVS and how you and your employer can be involved in the final release.\nThis will also be a chance to hear first-hand about a couple of new programmes where you will see the SVSs being more widely used and required and how you can prepare your organizations for this significant impact this will have, whether you are developing applications or you are assessing them.\n\n*Bio:*\nJosh Grossman has worked as a consultant in IT and Application Security and Risk for 15 years now, as well as a Software Developer. This has given him an in-depth understanding of how to manage the balance between business needs, developer needs and security needs which goes into a successful software security programme.\n\nJosh is currently CTO for Bounce Security where he helps clients improve and get better value from their application security processes and provides specialist application security advice. His consultancy work has led him to work, speak and deliver training both locally and worldwide including privately for ISACA and Manicode and publicly for OWASP's Global AppSec conferences. In his spare time, he co-leads the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard project and is on the OWASP Israel chapter board.\n\nHe was also recognized as a Key Contributor for the OWASP Proactive Controls project and has also contributed to the OWASP Top 10 Risks project and the OWASP JuiceShop project.\n\n**OWASP Juice Shop**\n*Abstract:*\nOWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security training, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools!\n\nJuice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other security flaws found in real-world applications!\n\nAt this event, we will take a tour through the application, hack it live on screen, learn about Coding Challenges, CTF mode, cheat detection, custom theming, and more!\n\n*Bio:*\nBjoern Kimminich works as Product Group Lead Application Ecosystem at Kuehne + Nagel, responsible \u2013 among other things \u2013 for the Application Security program in corporate IT. He is an OWASP Lifetime Member, the project leader of the OWASP Juice Shop, and a co-chapter leader for the OWASP Germany Chapter. Bj\u00f6rn also currently chairs the OWASP Project Committee."

        "description": "This is the second of two events for OWASP Ottawa in the month of April.\n\n**Welcome to our in Person Meetup at the University of Ottawa**\n\nIn-Person Location:\n150 Louis-Pasteur Private, Ottawa,\nUniversity of Ottawa\nRoom 117\n\n**Health Notice:**\nBased on the [Ottawa Public Health Guidelines](https://www.ottawapublichealth.ca/en/public-health-topics/masks.aspx) we strongly recommend that attendees wear a mask while not presenting. This will reduce the risk of transmission and protect members who may have compromised immune systems.\n\n**Live Stream**:\nWe will continue to Live Stream on our YouTube channel. (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxSU-KvNmYusZEq6v4YK5Lw). Subscribe to our YouTube channel, set a reminder and you\u2019ll get a notification as soon as we go live!\n\n**YouTube Live Stream Link**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf3-pPYpnr0\n\n**6:00 PM EDT** Arrival, setup, mingle\n**6:30 PM EDT** Technical Talks\n\n1. **Introduction to OWASP Ottawa, Public Announcements.**\n2. **Passing Compliance Audit with DevSecOps is Easier than You Think. Here\u2019s How.**\n***Abstract:***\nBusiness people may not always understand all the technicalities of cyber threats and vulnerabilities, but rest assured they know what will happen if they don\u2019t comply with applicable laws and regulations which can easily result in hefty fines, revoked licences, losing customers, or even going to jail.\nThe challenge that many small, medium and even large companies that practice DevOps face is how to pass a compliance audit quickly and painlessly without breaking the bank on manual labour or spending months ferociously fighting auditors. It took almost a decade for IT to meld Dev and Ops into one cohesive consonance, but getting compliance, risk and audit folks to understand and accept DevOps as a new and unavoidable way of developing and running software sometimes creates an even greater challenge.\nIn this presentation, Simon Sulyma will explain where traditional compliance audits fell short in today\u2019s modern environments and explore how DevOps processes and tools can be used to effectively audit controls.\n***Bio:***\nSimon is a network administrator turned cyber security and risk professional, an avid hiker and mountain biker, a self-made chef, and a recovering ice cream addict. Simon is also raising two teenage kids, so you can't scare him. Simon spent his last 17 years designing, building, securing and auditing complex IT systems and networks, mostly at big banks. Simon is currently leading a team of eight amazing folks who do threat risk assessments at a large insurance company. He is a big fan of vendor-neutral certifications that start with \"C\" and holds a number of them as he thinks they look good in his resume.\n3. **We Taught Burp to Speak GraphQL: Automated Security Scanning of Your GraphQL API With Burp**\n***Abstract:***\nRest APIs have been the backbone of webapps for over a decade now, and it\u2019s treated us well. Inevitably, a challenger has approached and is gradually becoming the new industry standard. That is GraphQL, a query a language for your API. But shifts in tech trends also bring another inevitability, new and interesting ways to hack stuff. GraphQL is a growing target, and the pentesting tools have yet to keep up, leaving the criminals with more time and opportunity to probe and exploit vulnerabilities in your web apps.\nBurp Suite has been the defacto tool for Application Security professionals running DAST scans and penetration tests against web apps, and it\u2019s amazing Active Scan feature badly needed to be able to parse GraphQL. Our new plugin for Burp Suite allows the Active Scanner to competently point it\u2019s library of payloads at a GraphQL API, giving the defenders a chance to detect vulnerabilities before the criminals do.\n**Bio**:\nJared Meit, OSWE, has always had a passion for taking things apart, learning how they work, and forgetting how to put them back together. He was a professional software developer for 12 years before shifting his focus to Application Security 5 years ago. His dev experience allows him to create tools that developer's will actually want to use."

The second will be at our regular location at the University of Ottawa.\n\n**Welcome to our in Person Meetup at the Trend Office in Kanata**\nBefore the pandemic we use to meetup every so often in Kanata at lunch in the Trend offices amongst others. Now, we are restarting this tradition this April at the newly renovated Trend office in Kanata.\n\nTrend has renovated their Ottawa location and keen to show it off so they have a tour, refreshments (as in beer), and talks.\n\n**Trend office Location**:\n40 Hines Rd.\n**Trend Signup Page**: [https://resources.trendmicro.com/owasp-ottawa.html](https://resources.trendmicro.com/owasp-ottawa.html)\n\n**Live Stream**:\nWe will continue to Live Stream on our YouTube channel.

First released in 2003, the project has had several reorganizations and updates as it has reached a global audience. This presentation will briefly talk about OWASP the foundation, and OWASP Top 10 the project. But one hour is insufficient to talk about each element of the top 10. Instead, this presentation focuses on the investigation, lessons learned, and thrills and chills associated with The Three Friends that keep Garth up at night.\n\n**Speaker Bio**:\nGarth Boyd is a Senior Application Security Architect/Cloud Security Architect specializing in Secure Software Architecture and Ethical Hacking. He supports organizations wishing a designer, creator, and breaker to help them on their security path. A lifelong learner who enjoys crafting solutions to interesting and tough problems through architecture, threat modelling, mitigation design, and penetration testing. Researching new ideas, troubleshooting, communication, and thinking of six impossible things before breakfast are part of the journey. Currently, Garth is the OWASP Ottawa Chapter Leader and an independent consultant currently working with Mirai.\n\n**Magno Logan: Github Actions 101: Creating a DevSecOps Pipeline**\nOne of the main tools used in this process is a continuous integration (CI) tool that automates code changes from multiple developers working on the same project. In 2019, GitHub released its own CI tool called GitHub Actions. According to GitHub, GitHub Actions help you automate tasks within your software development life cycle, and it has been gaining a lot of adoption from developers.\nThis talk will demonstrate how GitHub Actions work and show security tools to protect your applications from attackers. First, we\u2019ll dive deeply into the Actions, the language, and the runners, the servers provided by GitHub to run your Actions. Then, we\u2019ll show how to run SAST, DAST, and SCA using open source or free tools into your pipeline just using GitHub Actions. We\u2019ll set up Actions for each tool to scan our application for security vulnerabilities at every pull request. We\u2019ll leverage CodeQL and Semgrep for SAST, OWASP ZAP and Nuclei for DAST, and Dependabot and OWASP Dependency Check for SCA.\n\n**Speaker Bio:**\nMagno Logan works as an Information Security Specialist for Trend Micro. He specializes in Cloud, Container, and Application Security Research, Threat Modelling, and DevSecOps. In addition, he has been tapped as a resource speaker for numerous security conferences around the globe."

There will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event at the venue.\n\n_What's going to happen?\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our OWASP Frankfurt Meetup hosted by **CHECK24 Frankfurt.**\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n* _Talk 1 - \\*\"\\***Enhancing security culture through security champions**\" by **Diana Waithanji**, Cybersecurity engineer at SAP.\nAs software development becomes increasingly fast-paced, the need for secure development practices has never been more urgent. Enter the security champion - an individual who advocates for security within their team and takes ownership of all security issues. In this talk, Diana will delve into the principles of success in advocacy through security champions, and explore methods for training software developers to become security champions themselves. Drawing on real-world examples, Diana will also showcase a partnership model in AppSec that has proven to be effective in enhancing security culture within development teams. If you want to learn how to foster a culture of secure development in your team, this talk is not to be missed!\n\n* _Talk 2 - \"**Beyond the Checkbox: Breaking out of Testing Frameworks**\" by **Jiska Classen**, As mobile applications handle sensitive data, ensuring their security is crucial. However, simply securing individual apps is not enough to stop real-world attackers who exploit devices through other avenues. This talk will explore unconventional security testing approaches that can help improve app security by addressing vulnerabilities in the operating system, hardware, and third-party libraries. Discover how attackers can exploit wireless interfaces, sandboxing, privilege checking bypasses, and more. Let's explore why these attack vectors are relevant in practice and how to address them beyond standard security testing checklists.\n\n_Afterwards? We will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility to **socialize** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **CHECK24 Frankfurt**.\n\n_When\nOur Meetup takes place on the last Wednesday of the month in April, namely on 26.04.2023 from 18:00 to 21.00 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nCHECK24 Frankfurt is located at Speicherstra\u00dfe 55 in Frankfurt am Main, ca. 15min within walking distance of Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nGet in touch with the Frankfurt Chapter Leads (Dan Gora or Jonas Becker)\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"
