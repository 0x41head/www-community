Runtime security tools don\u2019t understand SCA findings, and don\u2019t come in until production. What if you could marry SCA with runtime analysis during dev, test, and prod?\n\nIn this session, we will discuss how the next generation of AppSec needs to go beyond just integrating static SCA into your CI pipeline, to analyzing insecure behaviors inside running apps and correlating that back to SCA to understand which vulnerable components are actually loaded into memory and used by your application. This new approach to AppSec will detect both known vulnerabilities/CVEs with SCA scans and unknown vulnerabilities with runtime analysis. It will then prioritize known vulnerabilities with runtime correlation of SCA findings. End result: you catch most of the key risks in your app, prioritize the key items your devs need to work on without flooding them with alerts, and remove unused components from your containers to burn down your CVE debt rapidly\u2026.and achieve the true mission of AppSec\u2026to empower engineering and security teams to create secure applications.\"\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: *[Deepfactor](https://www.deepfactor.io/)*\n*Deepfactor Developer Security is a new approach to AppSec that is cloud-native and developer-friendly. It helps enterprises address supply chain and DevSecOps initiatives with a unique technology approach that combines SCA (Software Composition Analysis), SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) and Runtime Security.*\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available**\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

Together they have 400 packages. When you run a container scan with an SCA (Software Composition Analysis) tool, you notice that 120 of them have vulnerabilities. Your security team is asking you to fix all the critical and high vulnerabilities, but your dev/DevOps team doesn\u2019t have the cycles. What do you do?\n\nToday, developers and DevOps engineers are being asked to address vulnerabilities and supply chain risks in container images. However, the volume of noisy security alerts often leads to developers ignoring them entirely or wasting valuable sprint time researching \u201cfalse positives.\u201d This session will focus on how security and engineering teams can correlate vulnerabilities with runtime information, prioritize alerts based on usage, and filter out false positives that don\u2019t represent a true exposure of a vulnerability. Understanding runtime information can provide intelligence such as applicability of the CVE to the running environment, reachability, and usage. This session will focus on usage. Prioritizing security updates to only used packages in your container image is a highly effective approach to reducing alert fatigue with your container scans. In addition, your DevOps team can even consider removing some of the unused packages and shrink your container images.\n\nAs an example, the session will include a demonstration of a typical SCA static container scan of a sample open-source test application and then show how an engineering team can filter alerts to reduce the number of vulnerable and used alerts that actually need to be fixed by developers by up to 90%.\n\n**Bio:**\nKiran Kamity is the Founder & CEO of Deepfactor. He is a serial Silicon Valley entrepreneur with a passion for building products that meet a need and make a business impact\u2014with Deepfactor that\u2019s empowering engineering teams to create secure cloud native applications. Prior to Deepfactor, Kiran was the Head of Product at Cisco Cloud BU, Founder/CEO at ContainerX (acquired by Cisco), and the Founder/VP at RingCube (acquired by Citrix).

A new and unique security condition has emerged that has no IOC\u2019s or TTP\u2019s. However, it is arguably the most dangerous of all emerging threats. If exploited, it can alter elections, destabilize governments, and bring a swift end to truth and the institutions that rely on truth. The future of information security is detecting and preventing the spread of \u201cdisinformation\u201d.\n\nPart 1 of this series focused on the origins of \u201cactive measures\u201d in the Cold War and the events leading up to January 6th 2021. Part 2 of this series, will focus on a new framework to map disinformation tactics and techniques, and the impact AI based chatbots and \u201cdeepfake\u201d technology will have on the future of democracy.\n\nWithout trust, democracy has no future. Can the security community help to restore trust in information and save democracy for posterity?\n\n**Bio:**\nBrandon has over 12 years of IT/InfoSec experience working as a server admin, network engineer, and security engineer.

Career consultants often hear this exasperated plea for help: \u201cHow do I get experience doing something new, when the companies I am talking to only want to hire people who already have experience?\u201d Lori is a former computer engineer and technology executive who will explain how candidates can gain key engineering work experience by volunteering. Volunteers participate in a very wide range of opportunities: from meetups to open source projects to service to the country. This talk will explain how to leverage a volunteer accomplishment with strategic integration into resumes and job interviews.\n\n**Bio:**\nLori Barfield joined her first Internet startup during the original .com boom as a Senior System Administrator, at a company that eventually went public. After moving into leadership there, she started an international executive consulting practice.\nLori\u2019s volunteer career began as a Chair for the Southern California Linux Expo. She has been a conference organizer and speaker in the Open Source world for 15 years. She also co-founded the cyber security conference ShellCon in 2017, and RaiseMe IT along with that. Through RaiseMe she has spoken and taught about career development at dozens of technical events across the country. Five years ago, Lori answered the call to duty and joined the Coast Guard Auxiliary. She is a Division Vice Commander and serves on the National Cybersecurity Penetration Testing team.\n\n**Schedule:**\n6:00pm - 6:30pm Networking, Food & Drink\n6:30pm - 7:30pm First Presentation\n7:30pm - 8:15pm Second Presentation\n\n### **Code of Conduct**\n\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

        "description": "Web APIs are a common glue that connect people and processes with digital systems all across the globe. Not surprisingly, Web APIs contribute more than 80% of the Internet traffic today. Given the importance of APIs, OWASP has recommended top-10 API specific security vulnerabilities (such as Broken Authentication/Authorization and Excessive Data Exposure problems) that organizations must address to strengthen their security posture. Albeit useful, these API specific vulnerabilities do not necessarily translate to the same business risks. For instance, two APIs from an organization with Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) may pose very different business risks to that organization.\n\nIn this session, we'll talk about API Risk Rating System (ARRS) that maps API specific vulnerabilities to business risks such as Legal/Contractual, Operational, Financial, Reputational and Regulatory. Similar in-principle yet different than Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), the main objective of ARRS is to prioritize API specific vulnerabilities based on their business risks. We'll describe the methodology behind the system developed using thousands of APIs that are being tracked at a global scale. We\u2019ll also share some hands-on practical scenarios.\n\nThe work presented was done by Samantha Sanchez, Jun Hee Lee, Alberto Ciconi and Baljeet Malhotra. Samantha, Jun Hee and Alberto are MSc Cybersecurity students at NYIT. Baljeet is an Adjunct Professor at NYIT, UBC, UVic, UNBC, and CEO of TeejLab Inc.\n\n**Location TBD**"
