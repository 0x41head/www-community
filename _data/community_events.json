To further exacerbate the challenge, security practitioners often lack both visibility and domain expertise of the SaaS application control set required to mitigate the risk of data theft and breaches.\n\nIn the hands of the business, SaaS enables organizations to move more quickly and with greater agility, but they often do so without any security guard rails or checks beyond a supplier risk assessment during procurement. With industry analysts estimating that 99% of data leaks and breaches in SaaS will be due to application and platform misconfigurations, this leaves companies exposed to potential ticking time bombs or blind spots.\n\nJoin this virtual event to discuss:\n\n\\- Common security gaps in SaaS applications and data exposure points\n\\- Pitfalls of building on top of the PaaS layer and inadvertently leveraging security by obscurity techniques\n\\- The anatomy of a SaaS breach and best practices for the SaaS threat model\n\\- Comparisons of different cloud and SaaS security technologies and approaches\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nJoin Zoom Meeting\nhttps://us06web.zoom.us/j/89925436170?pwd=RXlmSHlQWlFqZ3VzdkkySy9JWGMyZz09\nMeeting ID: 899 2543 6170\nPasscode: 534889\nOne tap mobile\n+13462487799,,89925436170# US (Houston)\n+12532050468,,89925436170# US\nDial by your location\n+1 346 248 7799 US (Houston)\n+1 253 205 0468 US\n+1 253 215 8782 US (Tacoma)\n+1 669 444 9171 US\n+1 669 900 6833 US (San Jose)\n+1 719 359 4580 US\n+1 309 205 3325 US\n+1 312 626 6799 US (Chicago)\n+1 360 209 5623 US\n+1 386 347 5053 US\n+1 507 473 4847 US\n+1 564 217 2000 US\n+1 646 931 3860 US\n+1 689 278 1000 US\n+1 929 436 2866 US (New York)\n+1 301 715 8592 US (Washington DC)\n+1 305 224 1968 US\nMeeting ID: 899 2543 6170\nFind your local number: https://us06web.zoom.us/u/kc1kZ35Pml"

There will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event at the venue.\n\n_What's going to happen?\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our OWASP Frankfurt Meetup hosted by **CHECK24 Frankfurt.**\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n* _Talk 1 - \"**AI-Enhanced Application Security: A Modern Approach**\" by **Diana Waithanji**, Cybersecurity engineer at SAP.\nThis talk will discuss how AI is being used to solve application security issues. We will explore the potential benefits of using AI in this area, such as increased efficiency and effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Additionally, we will discuss some of the challenges and limitations that come with using AI in application security and how they can be addressed.\n* _Talk 2 - \"**Beyond the Checkbox: Breaking out of Testing Frameworks**\" by **Jiska Classen**, As mobile applications handle sensitive data, ensuring their security is crucial. However, simply securing individual apps is not enough to stop real-world attackers who exploit devices through other avenues. This talk will explore unconventional security testing approaches that can help improve app security by addressing vulnerabilities in the operating system, hardware, and third-party libraries. Discover how attackers can exploit wireless interfaces, sandboxing, privilege checking bypasses, and more. Let's explore why these attack vectors are relevant in practice and how to address them beyond standard security testing checklists.\n\n_Afterwards? We will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility to **socialize** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **CHECK24 Frankfurt**.\n\n_When\nOur Meetup takes place on the last Wednesday of the month in April, namely on 26.04.2023 from 18:00 to 21.00 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nCHECK24 Frankfurt is located at Speicherstra\u00dfe 55 in Frankfurt am Main, ca. 15min within walking distance of Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nGet in touch with the Frankfurt Chapter Leads (Dan Gora or Jonas Becker)\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"

Or to be more precise, for those which cannot attend in Hamburg we're going hybrid as we'll actually try out some new toys to stream this event in parallel!\n\nWe'll start the meeting itself at 18:00 CEST and will begin the main talk and streaming at around 18:30 CEST!\n\nIn a nutshell\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nLocation: Kuehne+Nagel, Gro\u00dfer Grasbrook 11-13, 20457 Hamburg\nStart: 18th of April, 6pm CEST (start of stream \\~6:30 CEST)\nTitle: OWASP Raider [hybrid]\nSpeaker: Daniel Neagaru\nNetworking: After-talk beer somewhere in the vicinity of the venue\n\nAbstract\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nRaider was created to fill a gap in current tooling for pentesting the authentication process. It abstracts the client-server information exchange as a finite state machine. Each step comprises one request with inputs, one response with outputs, arbitrary actions to do on the response, and conditional links to other stages. Thus, a graph-like structure is created. This architecture works not only for authentication purposes but can be used for any HTTP process that needs to keep track of states.\n\nA few years ago, the author had the task of helping developers to build OAuth directly from RFCs, supporting them with security topics and questions. In the beginning, the project ran into some challenges. Early on, we faced the fact that authentication is a stateful process, while HTTP is a stateless protocol.\n\nBurpSuite and ZAProxy were incepted when the web did not have states, so they inherited a stateless architecture. REST APIs became popular some years after those tools were created. They have workarounds like Burpsuite macros and ZAP Zest scripts to pass information between requests, but we found that functionality lacking and too complex to implement.\n\nSo the author wrote custom python scripts to pentest this. It worked fine, but doing this makes the scripts usable only on this system. Therefore, the author decided to create a tool that fills that gap.\n\nRaider's configuration is inspired by Emacs. Hylang is used, which is LISP on top of Python. LISP is used because of its \"Code is Data, Data is Code\" property. It would also allow generating configuration automatically easily in the future. Flexibility is in its DNA, meaning it can be infinitely extended with actual code. Since all configuration is stored in cleartext, reproducing, sharing or modifying attacks becomes easy.\n\nProject Links:\n\\- Website: [https://raiderauth.com/](https://raiderauth.com/)\n\\- Source: [https://github.com/OWASP/raider](https://github.com/OWASP/raider)\n\\- Documentation: [https://docs.raiderauth.com/en/latest/](https://docs.raiderauth.com/en/latest/)\n\\- Twitter: @raiderauth\n\\- Mastodon: @raiderauth@infosec\\.exchange\n\nHow to participate\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nA) Come to the venue!

        "description": "**TOPIC**: How to Identify Threat Modeling Limitations\nJoin us for great networking, dinner and drinks, and see a presentation by Joshua Williams, Senior Solutions Architect at IriusRisk.\n\n**ABSTRACT**: Many cyber and application security tools love to say they can do everything needed to protect your assets. It isn\u2019t rocket science to know that\u2019s not true. It\u2019s helpful to consider the limitations of tools and processes. This presentation will take attendees through how to define the limitations of threat modeling correctly, understand best practices in how, when, and by whom a proper threat model should be performed, and how this process of identifying threat model limitations can help users better understand its utility to systems and processes.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: [IriusRisk](https://www.iriusrisk.com/)\n*When it comes to application development, security is paramount. With **IriusRisk**\u2019s automated, scalable and easy-to-use threat modeling platform, your engineers can iron out architectural security flaws before writing code, helping you avoid costly re-design and get to market faster with secure products your customers can rely on.*\n\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*"

Not only are two major releases in the pipeline (5.0 and 2.0 respectively) but we are now seeing industry stand up, take notice and start expecting more from applications, based on these standards. In this talk, Josh Grossman (one of the ASVS project leaders) will take you through these key developments including our vision for the upcoming version 5.0 of the ASVS and how you and your employer can be involved in the final release.\nThis will also be a chance to hear first-hand about a couple of new programmes where you will see the SVSs being more widely used and required and how you can prepare your organizations for this significant impact this will have, whether you are developing applications or you are assessing them.\n\n*Bio:*\nJosh Grossman has worked as a consultant in IT and Application Security and Risk for 15 years now, as well as a Software Developer. This has given him an in-depth understanding of how to manage the balance between business needs, developer needs and security needs which goes into a successful software security programme.\n\nJosh is currently CTO for Bounce Security where he helps clients improve and get better value from their application security processes and provides specialist application security advice. His consultancy work has led him to work, speak and deliver training both locally and worldwide including privately for ISACA and Manicode and publicly for OWASP's Global AppSec conferences. In his spare time, he co-leads the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard project and is on the OWASP Israel chapter board.\n\nHe was also recognized as a Key Contributor for the OWASP Proactive Controls project and has also contributed to the OWASP Top 10 Risks project and the OWASP JuiceShop project.\n\n**OWASP Juice Shop**\n*Abstract:*\nOWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security training, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools!\n\nJuice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other security flaws found in real-world applications!\n\nAt this event, we will take a tour through the application, hack it live on screen, learn about Coding Challenges, CTF mode, cheat detection, custom theming, and more!\n\n*Bio:*\nBjoern Kimminich works as Product Group Lead Application Ecosystem at Kuehne + Nagel, responsible \u2013 among other things \u2013 for the Application Security program in corporate IT. He is an OWASP Lifetime Member, the project leader of the OWASP Juice Shop, and a co-chapter leader for the OWASP Germany Chapter. Bj\u00f6rn also currently chairs the OWASP Project Committee."

Here\u2019s How.**\n***Abstract:***\nBusiness people may not always understand all the technicalities of cyber threats and vulnerabilities, but rest assured they know what will happen if they don\u2019t comply with applicable laws and regulations which can easily result in hefty fines, revoked licences, losing customers, or even going to jail.\nThe challenge that many small, medium and even large companies that practice DevOps face is how to pass a compliance audit quickly and painlessly without breaking the bank on manual labour or spending months ferociously fighting auditors. It took almost a decade for IT to meld Dev and Ops into one cohesive consonance, but getting compliance, risk and audit folks to understand and accept DevOps as a new and unavoidable way of developing and running software sometimes creates an even greater challenge.\nIn this presentation, Simon Sulyma will explain where traditional compliance audits fell short in today\u2019s modern environments and explore how DevOps processes and tools can be used to effectively audit controls.\n***Bio:***\nSimon is a network administrator turned cyber security and risk professional, an avid hiker and mountain biker, a self-made chef, and a recovering ice cream addict. Simon is also raising two teenage kids, so you can't scare him. Simon spent his last 17 years designing, building, securing and auditing complex IT systems and networks, mostly at big banks. Simon is currently leading a team of eight amazing folks who do threat risk assessments at a large insurance company. He is a big fan of vendor-neutral certifications that start with \"C\" and holds a number of them as he thinks they look good in his resume.\n3. **We Taught Burp to Speak GraphQL: Automated Security Scanning of Your GraphQL API With Burp**\n***Abstract:***\nRest APIs have been the backbone of webapps for over a decade now, and it\u2019s treated us well. Inevitably, a challenger has approached and is gradually becoming the new industry standard. That is GraphQL, a query a language for your API. But shifts in tech trends also bring another inevitability, new and interesting ways to hack stuff. GraphQL is a growing target, and the pentesting tools have yet to keep up, leaving the criminals with more time and opportunity to probe and exploit vulnerabilities in your web apps.\nBurp Suite has been the defacto tool for Application Security professionals running DAST scans and penetration tests against web apps, and it\u2019s amazing Active Scan feature badly needed to be able to parse GraphQL. Our new plugin for Burp Suite allows the Active Scanner to competently point it\u2019s library of payloads at a GraphQL API, giving the defenders a chance to detect vulnerabilities before the criminals do.\n**Bio**:\nJared Meit, OSWE, has always had a passion for taking things apart, learning how they work, and forgetting how to put them back together. He was a professional software developer for 12 years before shifting his focus to Application Security 5 years ago. His dev experience allows him to create tools that developer's will actually want to use."

Since it was born in 2005 due to research by Watchfire, it would disappear for a few years only to emerge back only now and then. Recent years have shown a real avalanche of reports related to HTTP misconfigurations, developing several variations of the attack and related attacks. In this short, technical talk, I'd like to show a few interesting examples of this vulnerability and try to answer the question - why it is so difficult for us to finally get rid of it? (about 30 min + discussion)\n2. After the break there is a room for **short lightning talks** with discussion (typical format is 5-10 minute talk followed by 5-10 minute discussion). [Please submit your ideas](https://forms.gle/7JFiD3z2tKifogvs5) or just show up.\n* OWASP ASVS 2.1.7 - how to do it right? (Marcin Szyd\u0142owski)\n3. Job announcements.

There will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event at the venue.\n\n_What's going to happen?\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our OWASP Frankfurt Meetup hosted by **CHECK24 Frankfurt.**\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n* _Talk 1 - \"**AI-Enhanced Application Security: A Modern Approach**\" by **Diana Waithanji**, Cybersecurity engineer at SAP.\nThis talk will discuss how AI is being used to solve application security issues. We will explore the potential benefits of using AI in this area, such as increased efficiency and effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Additionally, we will discuss some of the challenges and limitations that come with using AI in application security and how they can be addressed.\n* _Talk 2 - \"**Beyond the Checkbox: Breaking out of Testing Frameworks**\" by **Jiska Classen**, As mobile applications handle sensitive data, ensuring their security is crucial. However, simply securing individual apps is not enough to stop real-world attackers who exploit devices through other avenues. This talk will explore unconventional security testing approaches that can help improve app security by addressing vulnerabilities in the operating system, hardware, and third-party libraries. Discover how attackers can exploit wireless interfaces, sandboxing, privilege checking bypasses, and more. Let's explore why these attack vectors are relevant in practice and how to address them beyond standard security testing checklists.\n\n_Afterwards? We will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility to **socialize** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **CHECK24 Frankfurt**.\n\n_When\nOur Meetup takes place on the last Wednesday of the month in April, namely on 26.04.2023 from 18:00 to 21.00 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nCHECK24 Frankfurt is located at Speicherstra\u00dfe 55 in Frankfurt am Main, ca. 15min within walking distance of Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nGet in touch with the Frankfurt Chapter Leads (Dan Gora or Jonas Becker)\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"
