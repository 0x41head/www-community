He conceptualized the world's first \"API Composition Analysis\" based on source code static analysis. He founded TeejLab in 2017 and steered the team to build API Discovery and Security\u2122, world's first comprehensive end-to-end API Management platform. Prior to TeejLab, he established the R&amp;D unit of Black Duck Software in 2016 (acquired by Synopsys), he has also served as Research Director at SAP. He received a PhD in Computing Science from the University of Alberta and won several awards including NSERC (Canada) scholar in 2005 and Global Young Scientist (Singapore). He concurrently holds Adjunct Professor positions at the University of British Columbia, University of Victoria and University of Northern BC.</p> <p>Abstract : \u201cA Workshop on Zero Trust and API Risk Management\u201d</p> <p>Web applications have revolutionized our digital world. 96% of such web applications are built using some Open Source [Black Duck]. Furthermore, 99% of such Open Source based applications contain some Web APIs [TeejLab]. It\u2019s not surprising that Akamai estimated that 83% of the internet traffic today is via Web APIs that connect digital applications at a global scale. The growing API usage impacts organizations both positively (through innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, etc.) and negatively (due to security vulnerabilities, business disruptions, legal and compliance issues etc.). Gartner has predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at enterprises, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs by managing API risks proactively. This workshop will provide an overview of an API Governance framework to manage API security and legal risks. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can adopt for effective API Risk Management. We\u2019ll highlight best practices, both manual and automated, with relevant hands-on examples and scenarios.</p> <p>Provisional Agenda</p> <p>17:30 - Webinar waiting lobby opens<br/>18:40 - Presentation followed by Questions and Answers<br/>19:30 - Closing</p> "

If you are launching a microservice into a Kubernetes cluster, or even building an entire AWS virtual infrastructure, IaC can automate the deployment. By building repeatable templates you can also ensure that deployments happen exactly as you design, every time. However, errors in infrastructure configuration are now regarded as the second biggest cause of data breaches. There are many ways to give adversaries an advantage through security misconfigurations. Overly permissive storage volumes, unauthenticated database access, or ports left open to the internet have all been a cause of compromise. The solution? Treat your infrastructure code the same as your application code. During your build process, use tools to scan for infrastructure misconfigurations. When you find them raise alerts or even break the build.</p> <p>In this session, we will discuss common types of IaC misconfigurations, and demonstrate a free, open-source security tool that developers can build into their pipelines to help protect infrastructure from compromise.</p> <p>About Ori Bendet:</p> <p>An experienced product leader combining strong technical and marketing skills, Ori has been leading Checkmarx's flagship product, CxSAST (Static Application Security Testing), a Gartner and Forrester market-leading solution, serving thousands of customers worldwide for the last 2 years.

He's an open so(u)rcerer and has built or contributed to a wide variety of security tools, both offensive and defensive.

The good, the bad and the ugly of web fuzzing~<br/>Abstract: Web fuzzing is a powerful method for automating the boring tasks in both black box, and gray box testing of web applications. There's only so much one can do when approaching this kind of target manually but with proper tooling the server resources are the only limit. Wait? Server resources being the limit?</p> <p>Penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, security researchers and criminals are using the same techniques for different purposes. What happens when you are able to send tens of thousands of requests from your laptop, over the internet to a target. What if you scale it up horizontally, doing the same thing from hundreds of sources? What if the responding endpoint is intentionally slow - a login for example?</p> <p>At the cloud-native age, rate limiting might seem as an ancient thing from a distant past but for the very same reasons it's more relevant than ever...</p> "

Aside from offensive security practices, Ignatius has also led numerous cyber maturity assessment engagements, architecture review, and is currently an instructor at Seneca College.</p> <p>TALK<br/>-------</p> <p>Software Composition Analysis 101: Knowing what\u2019s inside your apps</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>The term Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is relatively new to the security world. However, similar approaches have been used since the early 2000s to indicate security verifications on open source components. SCA has become an evolution of that. It is the process of identifying and listing all the components and versions present in the code and checking each specific service and looking for outdated or vulnerable libraries that may impose security risks to the application. These tools can also check for legal issues regarding the use of open-source software with different licensing terms and conditions. Nevertheless, how those SCA tools work, and how can they help identify and remediate issues on open source libraries used in a codebase? This talk aims to focus on and explain to the audience by showing how these tools work and the main pieces of information that these tools rely on, such as the application manifest, vulnerability data sources, and dependency metadata.</p> <p>Audience Takeaways<br/>SCA tools and techniques are here to stay, and their usage is increasing in many organizations where security is a priority. Unfortunately, AppSec teams cannot keep up with all the new vulnerabilities published daily. Make sure to look for solutions that can adequately adapt to your own way of building software. They need to cover the programming languages used in your organization and identify issues on indirect dependencies, not just relying on public CVEs to find those issues.</p> <p>Presenter:</p> <p>Magno Logan works as an Information Security Specialist for Trend Micro. He specializes in Cloud, Container and Application Security Research, Threat Modelling and Red Teaming. He has been tapped as a resource speaker for numerous security conferences around the globe. He is also a member of the CNCF SIG-Security team</p> "

If you google his previous research you'll quickly understand that he is _very_ interested in breaking into your Android devices.</p> <p>In this talk we first explain how Java deserialization<br/>attacks chain code snippets called gadgets to e.g. execute arbitrary<br/>code. We then analyze real-worlds attacks and vulnerabilities to<br/>understand how vulnerabilities are patched and gadgets removed.</p> <p>Venue: <a href=\"https://link.mazemap.com/E5y5qO6Y\" class=\"linkified\">https://link.mazemap.com/E5y5qO6Y</a></p> "

Teams are adopting it very fast, but rarely with enough time to really understand how it works and what are all the right ways to configure and work with K8s. And lacking the knowledge in k8s can of course lead to various misconfigurations and security issues in k8s clusters. So in this episode, we will see some of the easy and practical ways to make sure we configure and run secure clusters.</p> <p>NANA JANASHIA<br/>Nana is a DevOps engineer and trainer. She started the Techworld with Nana channel to share her expertise about various DevOps topics and to help DevOps enthusiasts get into the field easier and with more motivation. Through her channel and different courses, she has reached millions of people. Her passion is to explain complex topics easily so that everyone understands them. She consults teams of developers to help them improve their existing processes for CI/CD, containerization and orchestration.</p> "
