But they do not get more experienced than these two!</p> <p>In my career path in IT security a handful of people stands out as having had the biggest influence and impact. Two of these are Richard Campbell (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/richjcampbell/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/richjcampbell/</a>) and Paula Januszkiewicz (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulajanuszkiewicz/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulajanuszkiewicz/</a>) and it is therefore a bit of a dream come true that we got them to speak at our meetup \u2013 And at the same meetup!</p> <p>Richard is probably best known from RunAsRadio (<a href=\"https://runasradio.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://runasradio.com</a>) and DotNetRocks (<a href=\"https://www.dotnetrocks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.dotnetrocks.com/</a>) and there have been days in my career where I have found myself talking more back at his podcast then I have talked with my wife that day!</p> <p>Paula is the founder and CEO of CQURE and has been giving presentations on security longer than I can remember. I try to listen/watch as many of them as possible because I always learn something and I am always entertained when she talks! And as she writes on her CV \u201cShe has access to the source code of Windows\u201d</p> <p>Mark this time and come join us!</p> <p>This event is purely virtual but feel free to meetup in groups and it will be updated with more information about the presentations later. It will be held in English</p> <p>The meetup will not be recorded.</p> <p>I will update this page with more information very shortly!</p> "

        "description": "<p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\u202fmakes deploying cloud or container configurations scalable and faster. If you are launching a microservice into a Kubernetes cluster, or even building an entire AWS virtual infrastructure, IaC can automate the deployment. By building repeatable templates you can also ensure that deployments happen exactly as you design, every time. However, errors in infrastructure configuration are now regarded as the second biggest cause of data breaches. There are many ways to give adversaries an advantage through security misconfigurations. Overly permissive storage volumes, unauthenticated database access, or ports left open to the internet have all been a cause of compromise. The solution? Treat your infrastructure code the same as your application code. During your build process, use tools to scan for infrastructure misconfigurations. When you find them raise alerts or even break the build.\u202f</p> <p>In this session, we will discuss common types of IaC misconfigurations, and demonstrate a free, open-source security tool that developers can build into their pipelines to help protect infrastructure from compromise.</p> <p>About Speaker - Ori Bendet<br/>An experienced product leader combining strong technical and marketing skills, Ori has been leading Checkmarx's flagship product, CxSAST (Static Application Security Testing), a Gartner and Forrester market-leading solution, serving thousands of customers worldwide for the last 2 years.

And when there are recalls of certain ingredients it\u2019s nice to quickly know whether those ingredients are already in your cupboard. Software Bills of Materials enable you to know what\u2019s in the software you consider procuring, and let you quickly know what\u2019s already inside your organization. Of course, you can even use them to understand the risk in the portfolio of software your organization baked itself! Since the May Executive Order on Improving the Nation\u2019s Cybersecurity SBOMs have gotten a lot more attention, but what does it really mean for an organization to make the most of this capability? This talk will help you prepare your organization for the near future when generating, evaluating, and leveraging SBOMs will be expected.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Greg Mohler is a Manager within KPMG's Cyber Defense practice, and has spent the past four years helping over 20 clients solve difficult problems related to DevSecOps, Application Security, and Vulnerability Management.

Those who haven't already are probably looking to migrating or are already running a hybrid IT environment. With the COVID outbreak there's even a greater demand today enable workers to work from anywhere and forces organizations to integrate cloud solutions quickly. But what about security? In this talk Benjamin will walk you through a brief introduction to the cloud and cloud security components, present common mistakes made in cloud environments and leave you with good cloud security resources and functions available at several cloud providers.<br/>Benjamin Svensson is a IT-security specialist in networking and infrastructure with everal years of experience with security products, penetration testing and network security. Co-founder and organizer of SecurityFest, a technical IT-Security conference on the Swedish West Coast!</p> <p>19:00 - 19:40 #2 Cloud Whisper - Connecting the dots between vulnerabilities and cloud compromises<br/>Running your infrastructure through a cloud provider is nowadays a no brainer, start small and scale to infinity and beyond. We have established the norm of continuous everything, but what effects does this extremely agile way of working have on security? This presentation will take a dive into the deep and often murky waters of common cloud security flaws, introduced by either vulnerabilities within your code base or through cloud misconfiguration. Jesper will showcase ways of exploiting common vulnerability classes that will severely make any DevOps, SysOps day a lot more interesting.<br/>Jesper Larsson is a freelance IT-security specialist and vulnerability researcher penetration tester, focusing on technical infrastructure with a special focus on orchestrations, infrastructure-as-code, deployment pipelines, cloud implementation and integrations. Working for multinational clients spanning several fields and helping companies, foundation entities with implementing secure infrastructure solutions worldwide.

Extensive use is made of open source software such as libraries and frameworks. While this is fantastic from a development point of view (allowing for faster development of applications and features), it does present a potential drawback if not done correctly, an increased risk. Often, we see libraries being used and seldom updated, also we see several libraries being blindly with little to not inspections and reviews. This is gold mine for attackers, there are many ways that they have will continue to use this to their advantage. The purpose of this talk is to cover some of the techniques which attackers could use to exploit open source supply chains. This will include a live demonstration of one such technique which an attacker could used. The talk will then focus on the excellent OWASP Dependency Track tool, showing how this can help reduce the risk to organizations when it comes to dealing with open source packages in software.</p> <p>BIO: Sean Wright is the Lead Application Security SME at Immersive Labs with an origin as a software developer. Primarily focused on web-based application security with a special interest in TLS related subjects. Experienced in providing technical leadership in relation to application security, as well as engaging with teams to improve the security of systems that they develop. Passionate to be a part of the community and giving back to the community. Additionally, enjoy spending personal time performing personal security-related research.</p> <p>Meeting info will be visible to you only if you RSVP for the meeting.</p> <p>ATTENTION SPONSORS: YOUR NAME COULD BE HERE<br/>Check out sponsorship opportunities here<br/><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-los-angeles-chapter-meeting-sponsorship-tickets-30572600471\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-los-angeles-chapter-meeting-sponsorship-tickets-30572600471</a></p> "

Writing secure code is even harder. Serious security vulnerabilities often stem from small programming mistakes. As developers, we can safeguard our applications by catching these mistakes in our own code.</p> <p>Performing a source code review is one of the best ways to find security issues in code. But how do you do it? In this workshop, we will first go through the basics of how to review your code for vulnerabilities and some tactics for performing an effective security code review on your application.</p> <p>But the process of manually analyzing code for vulnerabilities can be very time-consuming. In the second part of this talk, we will also talk about how to use the interactive code analysis tool Joern to make code analysis more efficient. How do you effectively trace user input in code? How can you efficiently link bug sources to sensitive sink functions?

Nettacker is able to run various scans using a variety of methods and generate scan reports for applications and networks, including services, bugs, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, default credentials and many other cool features - for example the ability to chain different scan methods. This relatively new (Summer 2017) and a lesser-known OWASP project has generated a huge amount of interest at BlackHat Europe 2018/2019 Arsenal live demo gathering massive crowds of seasoned hackers and penetration testers eager to see this new tool in action. This talk will showcase the OWASP Nettacker project giving an overview of its features and including a live demo of the tool.</p> <p>### Speaker Bio ###<br/>Sam Stepanyan is an OWASP London Chapter Leader and an Independent Application Security Consultant with over 20 years of experience in the IT industry with a background in software engineering and web application development. Sam has worked for various financial services institutions in the City of London specialising in Application Security consulting, Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), developer training, source code reviews and vulnerability management. He is also a Subject Matter Expert in Web Application Firewalls (WAF) and SIEM systems. Sam holds a Master\u2019s degree in Software Engineering and a CISSP certification.</p> "

Your company literally can scale at the click of a button. But if you take the simplicity of the cloud for granted, you wind up with brittle security that even a novice adversary can overcome. This talk will focus on identifying the holes in your cloud application before the attackers do, closing those gaps, and building architectures that can withstand the barrage of attacks that the Internet will throw at it.</p> <p>### Speaker Bio ###<br/>Josh Sokol, CISSP, graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BS in Computer Science in 2002. Since that time, he has worked for several large companies, including AMD and BearingPoint, spent some time as a military contractor, and recently left a ten year career as the Information Security Program Owner at National Instruments in order to pursue a full-time role as the Creator, CEO, and CISO of the free and open source risk management tool named SimpleRisk. Josh has spoken on dozens of security topics, including the much-hyped \u201cHTTPSCan Byte Me\u201d talk at Black Hat 2010, and served for four years on the OWASP Global Board of Directors.</p> "

Threat Modelling is an integral part of every company\u2019s Security Development Lifecycle. Still, as development teams grow more prominent, security will have to choose which features they want to Threat Model, or they will become a bottleneck for the development organization.</p> <p>Speaker Biography:</p> <p>Jeevan Singh is an Application Security Engineering Manager for Twilio Segment (<a href=\"https://segment.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://segment.com</a>), where he is embedding security into all aspects of the software development process.
