Here's what Jeff will be covering:\n\nAfter over 20 years, achieving app and API security still requires Herculean effort by smart and dedicated people. Fortunately, we can look to history and see a path forward. In the mid-2000s we changed the curve on kernel exploits by adding ASLR and DEP to operating systems. Imagine hardening your web app and web API stacks against all the major classes of vulnerability. You could instantly notify developers if they introduce a vulnerability and you could stop vulnerable software from being exploited. How would it change your appsec program if you could dramatically reduce the risk of all the common classes of vulnerability? In this talk, we\u2019ll explain how runtime protection works and how you can streamline vulnerability management and ensure your software doesn\u2019t get exploited\u2026 at the same time."

Allerdings sind sie auch bekannt f\u00fcr ihre subtil schwierige Anwendung und die damit verbundenen Sicherheitsl\u00fccken.\n\nRust tritt hier als vielversprechende Alternative auf: Es bietet die gleichen Vorteile in Bezug auf Leistung und Kontrolle, bringt jedoch auch Speichersicherheit und Threadsicherheit mit. Zudem l\u00f6st es weitere gesamte Klassen an Fehlern wie z.B. NULL-Pointer-Dereferenzierung auf.\n\nRust ist bereits jetzt fester Bestandteil des Linux- und Windows-Kernels und wird f\u00fcr neue Komponenten in Android eingesetzt.\n\nDie Kombination aus Leistung, Sicherheit und nicht zuletzt einer tollen Community mit hohen sozialen Standards macht Rust zur Sprache der Wahl f\u00fcr moderne Programmierung.\n\nDer Vortrag gibt einen kurzen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die Programmiersprache Rust und soll zum Auszuprobieren anregen. Dazu gibt es einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Live-Coding Anteil um zu zeigen wie die Arbeit mit Rust aussieht und welche Konzepte die Sprache so besonders machen.\n\n**Generelles zum OWASP-Stammtisch**\n===\n\nBei unseren offenen Treffen geht es um Software und deren Sicherheit im Internet und/oder IT-Security allgemein. Es treffen sich Leute, die sich beruflich oder privat damit auseinandersetzen: Entwickler, Manager, \"Pentester\" und alle an (Web)sicherheit interessierte. Die Atmosph\u00e4re ist offen und locker. Uns geht's um den Erfahrungsaustausch, Technikschnack und ums Netzwerken. Wer Produkte oder Dienstleistungen verkaufen will, ist hier falsch. Ihr seid herzlich willkommen Kollegen oder Bekannte den Hinweis auf unser Treffen weiterzuleiten. Alle Treffen sind frei, f\u00fcr jeden offen und kostenlos.\n\nSch\u00f6nen Gru\u00df, Bj\u00f6rn / Dirk"

In this talk, Adam will dive into residential proxies, tools that allow for requests from residential IP addresses. He'll clarify what these proxies are, who relies on them, and the possibilities they unlock. Additionally, he'll go over the process of how these large-scale proxy networks come to life.\n\nAdam will discuss the potential implications of these services on IP threat intelligence, the complications of carrier-grade NAT, and questions our reliance on geo-IP databases. He'll also shed light on how your internet use at home, school, or work might be effected by these services.\n\nFinally, Adam will touch on ongoing legal cases involving these services and reveal that some state actors are setting up their own proxy networks for data extraction purposes. The goal is to equip you with a comprehensive understanding of residential proxies, enabling you to make informed decisions within the field of internet security.\n\n**Here are the details of the event:**\n**Date:** July 11th 2023, 5:30pm\n**Venue**: Talenza, Level 3, Macquarie Place, Sydney\n\n**Schedule:**\n\n* 5.30 pm: Arrive, grab a drink, and meet your fellow attendees.\n* 6.00 pm: Residential Proxies Talk.\n* 6:30 pm: Q&A.\n* 7:00 pm: Networking.\n\n* 8:00 pm: Event ends\n\nRSVP now, and we'll see you there!\n\nBest regards,\nOWASP Sydney Chapter Committee"
