Learn From Others in the DevOps and DevSecOps Communities\nLook to the DevOps community to help close your critical knowledge gaps.\n2. 2\\. Start With Your Container Security\nThe first step to building out the security of your DevOps toolchain starts with your container security.\n3. Institute Continuous Compliance\nDevSecOps is a platform for continuous compliance to protect your software supply chains against vulnerable packages and vulnerable configurations.\n4. Double Down on Automation\nWhile you may have already been experimenting with automation during your DevOps phase, it only becomes more integral once you throw the switch in by going DevSecOps. Go into your DevOps to DevSecOps transformation with an automation strategy that focuses on automating common developer and sysadmin tasks.\n5. Improve Your Monitoring and Analytics\nBuilding out a DevSecOps toolchain takes your monitoring and analytics options to a new level. Consider the fact that you should already collect and publish data from your toolchain and deliver reports to your project managers, developers, QA testers, and stakeholders outside your team. Commonly, DevOps reporting is still a work in progress for organizations. Use the introduction of new security tools into your toolchain as a chance to offer more granular and real-time security reporting into all parts of your DevSecOps toolchain.\n6. Implement Accessibility Assurance\nDepending on your organization\u2019s definition of compliance, the option is there to add accessibility compliance or Section 508 to your DevSecOps toolchain.\n\nThis hands-on training is reserver for 70% professional and 30% students.\n\nMandatory:\n\nGeneral Conditions in order to validate your participation to this event:\n\n1\\. Student must send University/Student ID\\, otherwise registration will be rejected\\.\n\n2.Professional must register company emails, otherwise registration will be rejected.\n\nRegistration only via EventBrite. We don't accept answer via meetup.\n\nPlease indicate your firstname, lastname, company name, a valid business email or school email (email like gmai, free, hotmail, outlook, etc are not accepted and registration will be cancelled).\n\nPlease register here:\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/billets-devsecops-toolchain-transformation-374188276207"
