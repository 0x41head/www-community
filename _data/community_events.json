Many of you already know of him, he is a legend in the Application Security industry.</p> <p>The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for web developers and web application security professionals. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. Companies should adopt this document and start the process of ensuring that their web applications minimize these risks. Using the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps the most effective first step towards changing the software development culture within your organization into one that produces more secure code.</p> <p>The OWASP Top Ten 2021 includes:<br/>- A01:2021-Broken Access Control<br/>- A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures<br/>- A03:2021-Injection<br/>- A04:2021-Insecure Design<br/>- A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration<br/>- A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components<br/>- A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures<br/>- A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures<br/>- A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failure<br/>- A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Jim Manico is the founder of Manicode Security where he trains software developers on secure coding and security engineering. He is also an investor/advisor for Nucleus Security, BitDiscovery, Secure Circle, KSOC and Inspectiv. Jim is a frequent speaker on secure software practices, is a member of the Java Champion community, and is the author of \"Iron-Clad Java: Building Secure Web Applications\" from Oracle Press. Jim also volunteers for the OWASP foundation as the project lead for the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard and the OWASP Cheatsheet Series.
