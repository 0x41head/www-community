DevOps, DevSecOps, Agile, CI/CD pipeline, etc., and chances are you have heard these terms when discussing the software development life cycle. What do those terms mean? With the recent increasing cyber-attacks on software such as in-house developed code or software supply chain (open source software), the traditional ways of decreasing the attack surface on software applications no longer work effectively. Moreover, organizations are pressured to develop code faster and cheaper to meet customer demands. Mary will explain what DevSecOps is and how this practice is better than DevOps in security. In addition, how CI/CD fits in DevSecOps. Lastly, the popular tools are used in DevSecOps practices. She will provide the real-world experience challenges that she encountered.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: *[SAFEBASE](https://safebase.io/)*\n*SafeBase is the customer-facing Trust Center that automates B2B security reviews. Companies like LinkedIn, Asana, OpenAI, and Snyk use SafeBase to reduce security questionnaires, create a better buying experience, accelerate sales velocity, and position security as a revenue driver.*\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available** *Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to* *sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

Is there an easy way to scan, triage and follow-up on exposed secrets at enterprise scale? ABN Amro open sourced Repository Scanner and runs Repository Scanner internally at scale, exposing secrets in source code repositories and thereby raising security awareness while at the same time improving the security posture by remediating security misconfigurations.\n\n*Bio:*\nIngmar Vis has been working in CICD for 7 years. In his current role, Ingmar acts as a Product Owner for 2 teams at ABN Amro. 1 team is responsible for delivering the Secure Coding capability for all developers, the 2nd team is responsible for the infrastructure and automation of CICD tooling.

        "description": "Our current primary industry standard for detecting security issues in a software application is the use of either a DAST or SAST security tool which is then typically intertwined into the development pipeline. The hope being, as software changes, this data point helps us prevent some classes of vulnerabilities. The higher the risk associated with this data point, the more likely we are to intervene. As practitioners we accept that this singular data point has wildly varying levels of accuracy and we also accept that it will only find a subset of the vulnerability classes. Furthermore, we often rely upon this inaccurate signal and acknowledge that anything else is going to be caught by an attacker, a researcher or, our own appsec team. Ideally, not in that order.\n\nSome organizations have beefed up their approach and have begun using a second data point which is typically a dependency style scan tool. The bleeding edge appsec teams have begun also incorporating docker image CVE results as well as their own custom rules for their scanner tool. The fact remains though that these data points are not enough and that we have so much more available to us that can help us truly assess the risk that software changes introduce into our applications.\n\nDuring an almost six year tenure at GitHub, it became crystal clear not just how much data is available to defenders but also just how little of it is actually used to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced on a daily basis and finally, what those reliable signals are. If we know that scan tools have such huge limitations, why is the primary and sometimes only data point we rely on?\n\nEnter Contextual Security Analysis (CSA) which utilizes a S.L.I.D.E. methodology and incorporates many data points to contextualize code changes and ultimately detect risk. CSA synthesizes many markers and bits of information to produce contextually relevant risk scores.\n\nJoin us to learn how you can leverage CSA in your organization!"

        "description": "Web APIs are a common glue that connect people and processes with digital systems all across the globe. Not surprisingly, Web APIs contribute more than 80% of the Internet traffic today. Given the importance of APIs, OWASP has recommended top-10 API specific security vulnerabilities (such as Broken Authentication/Authorization and Excessive Data Exposure problems) that organizations must address to strengthen their security posture. Albeit useful, these API specific vulnerabilities do not necessarily translate to the same business risks. For instance, two APIs from an organization with Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) may pose very different business risks to that organization.\n\nIn this session, we'll talk about API Risk Rating System (ARRS) that maps API specific vulnerabilities to business risks such as Legal/Contractual, Operational, Financial, Reputational and Regulatory. Similar in-principle yet different than Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), the main objective of ARRS is to prioritize API specific vulnerabilities based on their business risks. We'll describe the methodology behind the system developed using thousands of APIs that are being tracked at a global scale. We\u2019ll also share some hands-on practical scenarios.\n\nThe work presented was done by Samantha Sanchez, Jun Hee Lee, Alberto Ciconi and Baljeet Malhotra. Samantha, Jun Hee and Alberto are MSc Cybersecurity students at NYIT. Baljeet is an Adjunct Professor at NYIT, UBC, UVic, UNBC, and CEO of TeejLab Inc."
