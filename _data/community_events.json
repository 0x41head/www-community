Most of them bust their butts working 60+ hour weeks. They have no social lives. They're constantly exhausted. They roll around at night unable to sleep. And worse, every time they wake up there's always some fire they have to put out.</p> <p>It doesn't have to be that way.</p> <p>This session shows you the strategy that allows you to absolutely eliminate burnout, kick stress to the curb, reconnect to your purpose, and actually enjoy your work again.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Edwin Sarmientois the Managing Director of 15C, a consulting and training company that specializes in designing, implementing and supporting SQL Server infrastructures.

In this talk, Jeff will approach application security from the \u201cinside out\u201d. We will show you how to create simple agents that get inside a running application (like a profiler or debugger) and give you access to everything you might want to know. We\u2019ll demonstrate real agents that identify vulnerabilities without changing any code, scanning, or extra steps. We\u2019ll identify vulnerabilities, analyze access control, and even prevent RCE attacks. Unlike scanning and firewalling, this approach establishes a safe and powerful way for development, security, and operations teams to collaborate. We\u2019ll discuss how software security instrumentation works, how it\u2019s being used in many organizations, and the implications for the practice of application security.</p> <p>Bio: Jeff brings more than 20 years of security leadership experience as co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Contrast Security. He recently authored the DZone DevSecOps, IAST, and RASP refcards and speaks frequently at conferences including JavaOne (Java Rockstar), BlackHat, QCon, RSA, OWASP, Velocity, and PivotalOne. Jeff is also a founder and major contributor to OWASP, where he served as Global Chairman for 9 years, and created the OWASP Top 10, OWASPEnterprise Security API, OWASP Application Security Verification Standard, XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet, and many more popular open source projects.

Most of the times these applications apply single security solution that they think can fit across the organizations.</p> <p>The aim of this presentation is to talk about different API security patterns that applications can think based on the data they are protecting and applying security solution pragmatically<br/>as one security solution cannot and should not fit for all the needs.<br/>The presentation will also cover different types of security tokens that applications can apply with the real-life scenarios and finally concluding that there is no single solution is better vs another.</p> <p>Learning Objectives:<br/>\u2022 Discuss monolithic applications vs microservices and its pros and cons.<br/>\u2022 Different types of tokens, SAML vs JWT vs OAuth2.<br/>\u2022 Role of Identity Provider and Service Provider.</p> "

(Manish Ahluwalia)</p> <p>Talk 1: The Tangled Web and Its Same Origin Policy</p> <p>Same Origin Policy is the Fundamental Security Model of the web, it's been very long that I have been struggling around Same Origin Policy and to overcome this struggle, I did some google and went through some books, watched some boring yet fruitful videos and ended up giving this talk. Having a deep understanding of the Same Origin Policy model is important especially if you are a Security Analyst or developer for secure web development.</p> <p>In this talk I will try to make it easy to understand and will keep your brains engaged so that it does not turn into a boring lecture. We will learn about Same Origin Policy with DOM, browser tabs, iframes, importance of SOP and how it is applied to web storage, images, CSS, JS, etc. I will also talk about Same Origin Policy exceptions and ways to get around Same Origin Policy with detailed explanation to postMessage API, URI fragment and CORS etc.</p> <p>Speaker Bio -<br/>Pankaj is Security Analyst at Appsecco.

Tim has an MBA from Santa Clara University, a BSEE from the University of Pennsylvania and BS from the Wharton School of Business.</p> <p>Talk 3: What's a data vault? And why do you need it? (Manish Ahluwalia)</p> <p>The complexity of hybrid data center infrastructures and the rise of<br/>compliance risk today has led to the creation of the data vault. These data vaults have been created by organizations of all sizes, from healthcare startups to digital-first financial services firms to solve the problem of governance for privacy data, such as your data of birth, your doctor\u2019s name and other PII. We will explore architectural patterns and best practices to create a privacy data vault that lets you store and easily govern sensitive data based on your needs.</p> <p>What you\u2019ll take away: what is data vault, how to adopt a data vault pattern, special considerations, and access controls.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Manish has over 2 decades of experience in the software industry, with over 10 years in information-security.

This month along with our normal OWASP &amp; AppSec News updates, Jim Manico will join us to talk about Request Forgery on the Web - SSRF, CSRF and Clickjacking!</p> <p>This technical talk on various forms of request forgery is meant for the software developer who needs to build secure software. Cross-Site Request Forgery, or CSRF, will allow an attacker to trick a user into submitting a transaction they never intended to submit. This attack-type requires very specialized defense. We will discuss various historical CSRF attacks and investigate a wide range of defensive strategies such as nonce tokens, SameSite cookies, and the double-cookie submit pattern. SSFF is a direct attacker category meant to trick your servers into making additional requests than never intended to. Clickjacking is a way to trick users into taking actions and entering data into one site while another is collecting those events. We will be helping developers stop forgery on the web in this talk!</p> <p>Jim Manico is the founder of Manicode Security where he trains software developers on secure coding and security engineering. He is also an investor/advisor for Nucleus Security, BitDiscovery, Secure Circle and Inspectiv. Jim is a frequent speaker on secure software practices, is a member of the Java Champion community, and is the author of \"Iron-Clad Java: Building Secure Web Applications\" from Oracle Press.

Historically, as an industry, we\u2019ve focused on building tools to identify vulnerabilities. While we\u2019ve built impressive tools, these approaches have failed to address the challenges of modern engineering teams. Specifically, these tools often are too slow, require a prohibitive amount of security engineer time and domain expertise to tune, overwhelm users with false positives, and most importantly, do not ultimately raise a company\u2019s security bar. But there\u2019s another way. Rather than investing in finding more bugs, some modern security teams are instead focusing on providing developers with frameworks and services with secure defaults (\u201cguard rails\u201d) so that developers can build features quickly and securely. When done correctly, combining secure defaults and lightweight checks that enforce invariants (properties that must always hold), organizations can solve *classes* of vulnerabilities by construction, preventing bug whack-a-mole. In this talk, we\u2019ll present a practical step-by-step methodology for:</p> <p>Choosing what to focus your AppSec resources on</p> <p>How to combine secure defaults + lightweight invariant enforcement to eradicate entire vulnerability classes</p> <p>How to integrate continuous code scanning into your CI/CD processes in a way that\u2019s fast, high signal, and low friction for developers</p> <p>How to use an open source, lightweight security linting tool to find bugs and anti-patterns specific to your company</p> <p>================================================================<br/>Speaker: Adam Berman<br/>================================================================<br/>Adam Berman is lead product engineer for r2c. In this role, he focuses on building and scaling the semgrep application in order to make it intuitive, easy to use, and reliable. Previous to r2c, Adam led the engineering team for Meraki Insight at Cisco Meraki, using ML and AI techniques to identify and solve performance problems in networked applications.

Jacobs, Director, Legal Counsel at Synopsys, Inc.</p> <p>Topic: Managing Open Source Associated Risk</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>In the 1 hour session, Matt will begin with general observations about the current state of open source reuse in software development today, calling on data from recent Synopsys studies concerning how open source is used, where it is used, why, and in what amounts. Next, general observations about the most popular open source license and compliance challenges will be addressed. Specific focus will be made on the key permissive and \u201ccopyleft\u201d licenses such as the MIT/BSD and GPL/AGPL respectively and touch on the emergence of source available licenses (MongoDB). This will include license interpretation and compliance challenges and enforcement actions.</p> <p>The conversation will then shift to open source and security. The unique challenges posed by open source will be discussed along with some ideas on how to address these challenges. We\u2019ll also spend a few moments analyzing the security breach at Equifax and exploring how mismanaged open source components were the root cause of that breach.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Matthew Jacobs was Vice President and General Counsel at Black Duck Software, Inc., recently acquired by Synopsys, Inc. He is now a director with the legal group at Synopsys. Organizations worldwide use Synopsys\u2019s industry-leading products to secure and manage open source software, eliminating the pain related to security vulnerabilities, compliance and operational risk. Matt\u2019s work at Synopsys includes managing licensing and contract negotiation and advising senior management on day-to-day legal affairs. In addition to being a frequent speaker on open source\u2013related topics, Matt routinely advises Synopsys\u2019s customers with respect to leading-edge open source adoption, use and compliance matters.</p> <p>Prior to joining Black Duck in 2009, Matt was with Bernstein Shur, where he counseled companies on a variety of intellectual property matters, including open source compliance.

Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.</p> <p>The Cyber Security and Networking (CSN) Research Group at Anglia Ruskin University has close working strategic relationships with industry, professional bodies, law enforcement, government agencies and academia in the delivery of operationally focused applied information and application security research. We have strong international links with professional organisations such as OWASP, BCS, ISC2, IISP &amp; the UK Cyber Security Forum amongst others. The primary aims of CSNRG are to help the UK and partner nations to tackle cybercrime, be more resilient to cyber attacks and educate its users for a more secure cyberspace and operational business environment. These will be achieved through the investigation of threats posed to information systems and understanding the impact of attacks and creation of cyber-based warning systems which gathering threat intelligence, automate threat detection, alert users and neutralising attacks. For network security we are researching securing the next generation of software defined infrastructures from the application API and control/data plane attacks. Other key work includes Computer forensic analysis, digital evidence crime scenes and evidence visualisation as well as Cyber educational approaches such as developing Capture the Flag (CTF) resources and application security programs.</p> <p>The BCS \u2013 Chartered Institute for IT - Cybercrime Forensics Special Interest Group (SG) promotes Cybercrime Forensics and the use of Cybercrime Forensics; of relevance to computing professionals, lawyers, law enforcement officers, academics and those interested in the use of Cybercrime Forensics and the need to address cybercrime for the benefit of those groups and of the wider public.</p> <p>Speaker Biographies &amp; Abstracts</p> <p>Kevin Mansell \u2013 Control F Ltd, Managing Director \u2013 \u201cThumbnail Images on Android and iOS Devices\u201d</p> <p>Bio: Kevin Mansell \u2013 Control F Ltd, Managing Director</p> <p>Kevin Mansell has been teaching mobile forensics since phones had buttons, initially as a course manager within the Centre for National High Tech Training at Wyboston and since 2007 when he founded Control-F. Control-F delivers vendor-neutral mobile forensics and computer forensics training to law enforcement agencies, private sector organisations and academic institutions in the UK and overseas.</p> <p>Prior to teaching digital forensics Kevin cut his teeth developing software within the telecoms industry unaware that the Unix commands, SQL queries and programming skills he was learning would ever be of interest to police officers.</p> <p>Abstract : \u201cThumbnail Images on Android and iOS Devices\u201d</p> <p>The recovery of thumbnail images from electronic devices is commonplace in digital forensics. We are often able to locate and recover thumbnail versions of images which existed, but have since been deleted, from a computer, mobile phone or tablet.</p> <p>In this session we will explore the possibilities of thumbnail recovery from Android devices and explain why the likelihood of such recovery has been diminished by recent versions of the operating system. We will also take time to introduce the monster which is the Photos.sqlite database on iOS and how it can shed light onto how a media file came to be present in the \"Camera Roll\" on an iOS device.</p> <p>Provisional Agenda</p> <p>18:00 - Webinar waiting lobby opens<br/>18:15 - Presentation followed by Questions and Answers<br/>19:30 - Closing, with virtual networking</p> "
