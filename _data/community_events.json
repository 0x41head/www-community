When a new vulnerability is released, we have to identify if our application is susceptible and then build a rule(s) to protect against these exploits. Pair this with applications and APIs that change with every release and we are left feeling uncertain.\n\nIn today's session we will deploy open source tools that leverage machine learning for web applications and APIs. These tools will help us learn about our applications and automatically apply the relevant protections. We can also learn about new exploits in the wild before an official CVE is released.\n\nSpeaker:\nRyan Rasmuss has been working as a security engineer for Check Point Software Ltd for about 5 years. During that time he\u2019s focused on Application Security and Threat Intelligence. Outside of work he\u2019s a big fan of local CTFs, golf, and camping!\n\n**Talk 2:**\n*Reducing Alert Fatigue with Container Scans: Correlate, Prioritize and Filter Based on Usage*\n\nDescription:\nToday, developers and devops engineers are being asked to address vulnerabilities and apply chain risks in container images. However, the volume of noisy security alerts often leads to developers ignoring them entirely or wasting valuable sprint time researching \u201cfalse positives.\u201d\nThis session will focus on how engineering teams can correlate vulnerabilities with runtime information, prioritize alerts based on usage, and filter out false positives that don\u2019t represent a true exposure of a vulnerability. Prioritizing security updates to only used packages in your container image is a highly effective approach to reducing alert fatigue with your container scans. In addition, your DevOps team can even consider removing some of the unused packages and shrink your container images. As an example, this session will include a demonstration of a typical SCA static container scan of a sample open-source test application and then show how an engineering team can filter alerts to reduce the number of vulnerable and used alerts that actually need to be fixed by developers by up to 90%.\n\nSpeaker:\nKiran Kamity is the Founder & CEO of Deepfactor. He is a serial Silicon Valley entrepreneur with a passion for building products that meet a need and make a business impact\u2014with Deepfactor that\u2019s empowering engineering teams to create secure cloud native applications. Prior to Deepfactor, Kiran was the Head of Product at Cisco Cloud BU, Founder/CEO at ContainerX (acquired by Cisco), and the Founder/VP at RingCube (acquired by Citrix). Kiran is a TEDx speaker and loves nature, travel, and food\n\n**Talk 3:**\n*Why are malicious bots still so difficult to mitigate?*\n\nDescription:\nThe first anti-bot technology, CAPTCHA, was developed over 20 years ago, yet bots are still buying up concert tickets, ruining sneaker launches, taking over bank accounts through credential stuffing, and costing organizations tens of millions of dollars in fraud and lost revenue. Let\u2019s learn why bots are still so difficult to mitigate, what techniques no longer work, and what it takes to effectively mitigate bots to keep your customers safe.\n\nSpeaker:\nJim Downey evangelizes app security for F5, which offers a comprehensive app security stack across data centers, edge, and multi-cloud. Formerly a Director of Engineering at Shape Security, acquired by F5, Jim focuses foremost on defending web, mobile, and APIs from malicious bot attacks."

To further exacerbate the challenge, security practitioners often lack both visibility and domain expertise of the SaaS application control set required to mitigate the risk of data theft and breaches.\n\nIn the hands of the business, SaaS enables organizations to move more quickly and with greater agility, but they often do so without any security guard rails or checks beyond a supplier risk assessment during procurement. With industry analysts estimating that 99% of data leaks and breaches in SaaS will be due to application and platform misconfigurations, this leaves companies exposed to potential ticking time bombs or blind spots.\n\nJoin this virtual event to discuss:\n\n\\- Common security gaps in SaaS applications and data exposure points\n\\- Pitfalls of building on top of the PaaS layer and inadvertently leveraging security by obscurity techniques\n\\- The anatomy of a SaaS breach and best practices for the SaaS threat model\n\\- Comparisons of different cloud and SaaS security technologies and approaches\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nJoin Zoom Meeting\nhttps://us06web.zoom.us/j/89925436170?pwd=RXlmSHlQWlFqZ3VzdkkySy9JWGMyZz09\nMeeting ID: 899 2543 6170\nPasscode: 534889\nOne tap mobile\n+13462487799,,89925436170# US (Houston)\n+12532050468,,89925436170# US\nDial by your location\n+1 346 248 7799 US (Houston)\n+1 253 205 0468 US\n+1 253 215 8782 US (Tacoma)\n+1 669 444 9171 US\n+1 669 900 6833 US (San Jose)\n+1 719 359 4580 US\n+1 309 205 3325 US\n+1 312 626 6799 US (Chicago)\n+1 360 209 5623 US\n+1 386 347 5053 US\n+1 507 473 4847 US\n+1 564 217 2000 US\n+1 646 931 3860 US\n+1 689 278 1000 US\n+1 929 436 2866 US (New York)\n+1 301 715 8592 US (Washington DC)\n+1 305 224 1968 US\nMeeting ID: 899 2543 6170\nFind your local number: https://us06web.zoom.us/u/kc1kZ35Pml"

There will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event at the venue.\n\n_What's going to happen?\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our OWASP Frankfurt Meetup hosted by **CHECK24 Frankfurt.**\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n* _Talk 1 - \"**AI-Enhanced Application Security: A Modern Approach**\" by **Diana Waithanji**, Cybersecurity engineer at SAP.\nThis talk will discuss how AI is being used to solve application security issues. We will explore the potential benefits of using AI in this area, such as increased efficiency and effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Additionally, we will discuss some of the challenges and limitations that come with using AI in application security and how they can be addressed.\n* _Talk 2 - \"**Beyond the Checkbox: Breaking out of Testing Frameworks**\" by **Jiska Classen**, As mobile applications handle sensitive data, ensuring their security is crucial. However, simply securing individual apps is not enough to stop real-world attackers who exploit devices through other avenues. This talk will explore unconventional security testing approaches that can help improve app security by addressing vulnerabilities in the operating system, hardware, and third-party libraries. Discover how attackers can exploit wireless interfaces, sandboxing, privilege checking bypasses, and more. Let's explore why these attack vectors are relevant in practice and how to address them beyond standard security testing checklists.\n\n_Afterwards? We will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility to **socialize** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **CHECK24 Frankfurt**.\n\n_When\nOur Meetup takes place on the last Wednesday of the month in April, namely on 26.04.2023 from 18:00 to 21.00 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nCHECK24 Frankfurt is located at Speicherstra\u00dfe 55 in Frankfurt am Main, ca. 15min within walking distance of Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nGet in touch with the Frankfurt Chapter Leads (Dan Gora or Jonas Becker)\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"

Or to be more precise, for those which cannot attend in Hamburg we're going hybrid as we'll actually try out some new toys to stream this event in parallel!\n\nWe'll start the meeting itself at 18:00 CEST and will begin the main talk and streaming at around 18:30 CEST!\n\nIn a nutshell\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nLocation: Kuehne+Nagel, Gro\u00dfer Grasbrook 11-13, 20457 Hamburg\nStart: 18th of April, 6pm CEST (start of stream \\~6:30 CEST)\nTitle: OWASP Raider [hybrid]\nSpeaker: Daniel Neagaru\nNetworking: After-talk beer somewhere in the vicinity of the venue\n\nAbstract\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nRaider was created to fill a gap in current tooling for pentesting the authentication process. It abstracts the client-server information exchange as a finite state machine. Each step comprises one request with inputs, one response with outputs, arbitrary actions to do on the response, and conditional links to other stages. Thus, a graph-like structure is created. This architecture works not only for authentication purposes but can be used for any HTTP process that needs to keep track of states.\n\nA few years ago, the author had the task of helping developers to build OAuth directly from RFCs, supporting them with security topics and questions. In the beginning, the project ran into some challenges. Early on, we faced the fact that authentication is a stateful process, while HTTP is a stateless protocol.\n\nBurpSuite and ZAProxy were incepted when the web did not have states, so they inherited a stateless architecture. REST APIs became popular some years after those tools were created. They have workarounds like Burpsuite macros and ZAP Zest scripts to pass information between requests, but we found that functionality lacking and too complex to implement.\n\nSo the author wrote custom python scripts to pentest this. It worked fine, but doing this makes the scripts usable only on this system. Therefore, the author decided to create a tool that fills that gap.\n\nRaider's configuration is inspired by Emacs. Hylang is used, which is LISP on top of Python. LISP is used because of its \"Code is Data, Data is Code\" property. It would also allow generating configuration automatically easily in the future. Flexibility is in its DNA, meaning it can be infinitely extended with actual code. Since all configuration is stored in cleartext, reproducing, sharing or modifying attacks becomes easy.\n\nProject Links:\n\\- Website: [https://raiderauth.com/](https://raiderauth.com/)\n\\- Source: [https://github.com/OWASP/raider](https://github.com/OWASP/raider)\n\\- Documentation: [https://docs.raiderauth.com/en/latest/](https://docs.raiderauth.com/en/latest/)\n\\- Twitter: @raiderauth\n\\- Mastodon: @raiderauth@infosec\\.exchange\n\nHow to participate\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nA) Come to the venue!

Here\u2019s How.**\n***Abstract:***\nBusiness people may not always understand all the technicalities of cyber threats and vulnerabilities, but rest assured they know what will happen if they don\u2019t comply with applicable laws and regulations which can easily result in hefty fines, revoked licences, losing customers, or even going to jail.\nThe challenge that many small, medium and even large companies that practice DevOps face is how to pass a compliance audit quickly and painlessly without breaking the bank on manual labour or spending months ferociously fighting auditors. It took almost a decade for IT to meld Dev and Ops into one cohesive consonance, but getting compliance, risk and audit folks to understand and accept DevOps as a new and unavoidable way of developing and running software sometimes creates an even greater challenge.\nIn this presentation, Simon Sulyma will explain where traditional compliance audits fell short in today\u2019s modern environments and explore how DevOps processes and tools can be used to effectively audit controls.\n***Bio:***\nSimon is a network administrator turned cyber security and risk professional, an avid hiker and mountain biker, a self-made chef, and a recovering ice cream addict. Simon is also raising two teenage kids, so you can't scare him. Simon spent his last 17 years designing, building, securing and auditing complex IT systems and networks, mostly at big banks. Simon is currently leading a team of eight amazing folks who do threat risk assessments at a large insurance company. He is a big fan of vendor-neutral certifications that start with \"C\" and holds a number of them as he thinks they look good in his resume.\n3. **We Taught Burp to Speak GraphQL: Automated Security Scanning of Your GraphQL API With Burp**\n***Abstract:***\nRest APIs have been the backbone of webapps for over a decade now, and it\u2019s treated us well. Inevitably, a challenger has approached and is gradually becoming the new industry standard. That is GraphQL, a query a language for your API. But shifts in tech trends also bring another inevitability, new and interesting ways to hack stuff. GraphQL is a growing target, and the pentesting tools have yet to keep up, leaving the criminals with more time and opportunity to probe and exploit vulnerabilities in your web apps.\nBurp Suite has been the defacto tool for Application Security professionals running DAST scans and penetration tests against web apps, and it\u2019s amazing Active Scan feature badly needed to be able to parse GraphQL. Our new plugin for Burp Suite allows the Active Scanner to competently point it\u2019s library of payloads at a GraphQL API, giving the defenders a chance to detect vulnerabilities before the criminals do.\n**Bio**:\nJared Meit, OSWE, has always had a passion for taking things apart, learning how they work, and forgetting how to put them back together. He was a professional software developer for 12 years before shifting his focus to Application Security 5 years ago. His dev experience allows him to create tools that developer's will actually want to use."

First released in 2003, the project has had several reorganizations and updates as it has reached a global audience. This presentation will briefly talk about OWASP the foundation, and OWASP Top 10 the project. But one hour is insufficient to talk about each element of the top 10. Instead, this presentation focuses on the investigation, lessons learned, and thrills and chills associated with The Three Friends that keep Garth up at night.\n\n**Speaker Bio**:\nGarth Boyd is a Senior Application Security Architect/Cloud Security Architect specializing in Secure Software Architecture and Ethical Hacking. He supports organizations wishing a designer, creator, and breaker to help them on their security path. A lifelong learner who enjoys crafting solutions to interesting and tough problems through architecture, threat modelling, mitigation design, and penetration testing. Researching new ideas, troubleshooting, communication, and thinking of six impossible things before breakfast are part of the journey. Currently, Garth is the OWASP Ottawa Chapter Leader and an independent consultant currently working with Mirai.\n\n**Magno Logan: Github Actions 101: Creating a DevSecOps Pipeline**\nOne of the main tools used in this process is a continuous integration (CI) tool that automates code changes from multiple developers working on the same project. In 2019, GitHub released its own CI tool called GitHub Actions. According to GitHub, GitHub Actions help you automate tasks within your software development life cycle, and it has been gaining a lot of adoption from developers.\nThis talk will demonstrate how GitHub Actions work and show security tools to protect your applications from attackers. First, we\u2019ll dive deeply into the Actions, the language, and the runners, the servers provided by GitHub to run your Actions. Then, we\u2019ll show how to run SAST, DAST, and SCA using open source or free tools into your pipeline just using GitHub Actions. We\u2019ll set up Actions for each tool to scan our application for security vulnerabilities at every pull request. We\u2019ll leverage CodeQL and Semgrep for SAST, OWASP ZAP and Nuclei for DAST, and Dependabot and OWASP Dependency Check for SCA.\n\n**Speaker Bio:**\nMagno Logan works as an Information Security Specialist for Trend Micro. He specializes in Cloud, Container, and Application Security Research, Threat Modelling, and DevSecOps. In addition, he has been tapped as a resource speaker for numerous security conferences around the globe."

Besides we have a room for lightening talks. **If you want to have lightning talk** please let us know in advance by [filling the form](https://forms.gle/7JFiD3z2tKifogvs5). This will help us to plan the meeting.\n\nAgenda:\n\n1. **The vulnerability of complex systems - (HRS) HTTP Request Smuggling** (Przemek Samsel)\nPresentation is about a never-ending story of HTTP Request Smuggling. Since it was born in 2005 due to research by Watchfire, it would disappear for a few years only to emerge back only now and then. Recent years have shown a real avalanche of reports related to HTTP misconfigurations, developing several variations of the attack and related attacks. In this short, technical talk, I'd like to show a few interesting examples of this vulnerability and try to answer the question - why it is so difficult for us to finally get rid of it? (about 30 min + discussion)\n2. After the break there is a room for **short lightning talks** with discussion (typical format is 5-10 minute talk followed by 5-10 minute discussion). [Please submit your ideas](https://forms.gle/7JFiD3z2tKifogvs5) or just show up.\n3. Job announcements. If you are an employer, there will be a chance to present who you are looking for.\n\nPlease RSVP and save the date!\nIf you have a minute, **please share this** with friends and in social media.\n\nWe would like to thank Codete for enabling us to organise our meetups in their Techie's Space.\n[Codete](https://codete.com/) is a software company based in Poland that specializes in custom software development and IT consulting."

There will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event at the venue.\n\n_What's going to happen?\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our OWASP Frankfurt Meetup hosted by **CHECK24 Frankfurt.**\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n* _Talk 1 - \"**AI-Enhanced Application Security: A Modern Approach**\" by **Diana Waithanji**, Cybersecurity engineer at SAP.\nThis talk will discuss how AI is being used to solve application security issues. We will explore the potential benefits of using AI in this area, such as increased efficiency and effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Additionally, we will discuss some of the challenges and limitations that come with using AI in application security and how they can be addressed.\n* _Talk 2 - \"**Beyond the Checkbox: Breaking out of Testing Frameworks**\" by **Jiska Classen**, As mobile applications handle sensitive data, ensuring their security is crucial. However, simply securing individual apps is not enough to stop real-world attackers who exploit devices through other avenues. This talk will explore unconventional security testing approaches that can help improve app security by addressing vulnerabilities in the operating system, hardware, and third-party libraries. Discover how attackers can exploit wireless interfaces, sandboxing, privilege checking bypasses, and more. Let's explore why these attack vectors are relevant in practice and how to address them beyond standard security testing checklists.\n\n_Afterwards? We will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility to **socialize** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **CHECK24 Frankfurt**.\n\n_When\nOur Meetup takes place on the last Wednesday of the month in April, namely on 26.04.2023 from 18:00 to 21.00 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nCHECK24 Frankfurt is located at Speicherstra\u00dfe 55 in Frankfurt am Main, ca. 15min within walking distance of Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nGet in touch with the Frankfurt Chapter Leads (Dan Gora or Jonas Becker)\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"
