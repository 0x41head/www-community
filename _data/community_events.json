This event is aimed at the beginner who wishes to know more about these two popular tools. This is an unbiased demonstration and both tools will be in an out-of-the-box state with no optional extras / add-ons / plugins installed.\n\n**Agenda:**\n\n* OWASP updates\n* Live interactive demonstration of ZAP and Burp Suite CE\n\nDisclaimer: As always our events are designed to educate.

There will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event at the venue.\n\n_What's going to happen?\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our OWASP Frankfurt Meetup hosted by **CHECK24 Frankfurt.**\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n* _Talk 1 - \\*\"\\***Enhancing security culture through security champions**\" by **Diana Waithanji**, Cybersecurity engineer at SAP.\nAs software development becomes increasingly fast-paced, the need for secure development practices has never been more urgent. Enter the security champion - an individual who advocates for security within their team and takes ownership of all security issues. In this talk, Diana will delve into the principles of success in advocacy through security champions, and explore methods for training software developers to become security champions themselves. Drawing on real-world examples, Diana will also showcase a partnership model in AppSec that has proven to be effective in enhancing security culture within development teams. If you want to learn how to foster a culture of secure development in your team, this talk is not to be missed!\n\n* _Talk 2 - \"**Beyond the Checkbox: Breaking out of Testing Frameworks**\" by **Jiska Classen**, As mobile applications handle sensitive data, ensuring their security is crucial. However, simply securing individual apps is not enough to stop real-world attackers who exploit devices through other avenues. This talk will explore unconventional security testing approaches that can help improve app security by addressing vulnerabilities in the operating system, hardware, and third-party libraries. Discover how attackers can exploit wireless interfaces, sandboxing, privilege checking bypasses, and more. Let's explore why these attack vectors are relevant in practice and how to address them beyond standard security testing checklists.\n\n_Afterwards? We will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility to **socialize** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **CHECK24 Frankfurt**.\n\n_When\nOur Meetup takes place on the last Wednesday of the month in April, namely on 26.04.2023 from 18:00 to 21.00 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nCHECK24 Frankfurt is located at Speicherstra\u00dfe 55 in Frankfurt am Main, ca. 15min within walking distance of Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nGet in touch with the Frankfurt Chapter Leads (Dan Gora or Jonas Becker)\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"

Contestants are presented with a set of challenges and puzzles which test their creativity, technical skills, vulnerability-finding skills and problem-solving ability. The challenges usually cover a number of categories and when solved, each yields a \u201cflag\u201d which is submitted to a real-time scoring service. The difficulty levels are from beginner to advanced.\n\nPlease note that unlike our OWASP London Chapter \u2018s previous CTFs this is not a secure coding tournament, but a proper \"Hacking CTF\". The challenges will be around finding and exploiting application vulnerabilities, not vulnerabilities in the source code.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Please **bring your own** **LAPTOP** and a **CHARGER** for it.\nTop 3 scorers will win exciting prizes generously provided by Invicti and other cyber security technology vendors.\n\nParticipation is FREE, but the **number of seats is strictly limited to 50** and **[registration is required](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/574787925157/)** to attend.\n\n**Please remember to bring your own laptop!**\n\n**IMPORTANT**: By participating in this activity you agree to abide by the\n\n**OWASP Code of Conduct** and **Invicti CTF Rules**:\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy our events, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

Not only are two major releases in the pipeline (5.0 and 2.0 respectively) but we are now seeing industry stand up, take notice and start expecting more from applications, based on these standards. In this talk, Josh Grossman (one of the ASVS project leaders) will take you through these key developments including our vision for the upcoming version 5.0 of the ASVS and how you and your employer can be involved in the final release.\nThis will also be a chance to hear first-hand about a couple of new programmes where you will see the SVSs being more widely used and required and how you can prepare your organizations for this significant impact this will have, whether you are developing applications or you are assessing them.\n\n*Bio:*\nJosh Grossman has worked as a consultant in IT and Application Security and Risk for 15 years now, as well as a Software Developer. This has given him an in-depth understanding of how to manage the balance between business needs, developer needs and security needs which goes into a successful software security programme.\n\nJosh is currently CTO for Bounce Security where he helps clients improve and get better value from their application security processes and provides specialist application security advice. His consultancy work has led him to work, speak and deliver training both locally and worldwide including privately for ISACA and Manicode and publicly for OWASP's Global AppSec conferences. In his spare time, he co-leads the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard project and is on the OWASP Israel chapter board.\n\nHe was also recognized as a Key Contributor for the OWASP Proactive Controls project and has also contributed to the OWASP Top 10 Risks project and the OWASP JuiceShop project.\n\n**OWASP Juice Shop**\n*Abstract:*\nOWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security training, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools!\n\nJuice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other security flaws found in real-world applications!\n\nAt this event, we will take a tour through the application, hack it live on screen, learn about Coding Challenges, CTF mode, cheat detection, custom theming, and more!\n\n*Bio:*\nBjoern Kimminich works as Product Group Lead Application Ecosystem at Kuehne + Nagel, responsible \u2013 among other things \u2013 for the Application Security program in corporate IT. He is an OWASP Lifetime Member, the project leader of the OWASP Juice Shop, and a co-chapter leader for the OWASP Germany Chapter. Bj\u00f6rn also currently chairs the OWASP Project Committee."

There will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event at the venue.\n\n_What's going to happen?\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our OWASP Frankfurt Meetup hosted by **CHECK24 Frankfurt.**\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n* _Talk 1 - \\*\"\\***Enhancing security culture through security champions**\" by **Diana Waithanji**, Cybersecurity engineer at SAP.\nAs software development becomes increasingly fast-paced, the need for secure development practices has never been more urgent. Enter the security champion - an individual who advocates for security within their team and takes ownership of all security issues. In this talk, Diana will delve into the principles of success in advocacy through security champions, and explore methods for training software developers to become security champions themselves. Drawing on real-world examples, Diana will also showcase a partnership model in AppSec that has proven to be effective in enhancing security culture within development teams. If you want to learn how to foster a culture of secure development in your team, this talk is not to be missed!\n\n* _Talk 2 - \"**Beyond the Checkbox: Breaking out of Testing Frameworks**\" by **Jiska Classen**, As mobile applications handle sensitive data, ensuring their security is crucial. However, simply securing individual apps is not enough to stop real-world attackers who exploit devices through other avenues. This talk will explore unconventional security testing approaches that can help improve app security by addressing vulnerabilities in the operating system, hardware, and third-party libraries. Discover how attackers can exploit wireless interfaces, sandboxing, privilege checking bypasses, and more. Let's explore why these attack vectors are relevant in practice and how to address them beyond standard security testing checklists.\n\n_Afterwards? We will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility to **socialize** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **CHECK24 Frankfurt**.\n\n_When\nOur Meetup takes place on the last Wednesday of the month in April, namely on 26.04.2023 from 18:00 to 21.00 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nCHECK24 Frankfurt is located at Speicherstra\u00dfe 55 in Frankfurt am Main, ca. 15min within walking distance of Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nGet in touch with the Frankfurt Chapter Leads (Dan Gora or Jonas Becker)\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"
