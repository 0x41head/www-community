For this evening we plan to have a workshop and a talk, and plenty of time for socializing/networking. Please reserve your seats as the space is limited and only RSVP if you are physically showing up, so we know how much pizza we should buy :)<br/>The virtual streaming will be anyways accessible to YouTube without the need to RSVP.</p> <p>17:00 - 17:10: Intro<br/>17:10 - 17:50: Talk: \"Did you just assume your product is secure?\" by Dmitry<br/>17:50 - 18:10: Talk: \"Protect your Domain Admins with tiering\" by Jonas<br/>18:10 - 18:30: Pizza and drinks will be served at ITU/ScrollBar<br/>18:30 - 20:30: ImproHound workshop, bring your own device with VMWare or VirtualBox to try the tool as described down below.</p> <p>1. Talk: Did you just assume your product is secure?<br/>People tend to assume things. I know I do. It's perfectly normal, it's how our brains evolved to work. Join me in exploring the role of assumptions in our everyday life and how that impacts the security of products we build. Or did I just assume that they do?.. Hmm.</p> <p>Dmitry started as a software engineer building a promising AAA title at an unknown game studio, and continued to be a firmware QA automation engineer and then a firmware developer. Despite that, he spent a lot of free time doing reverse engineering. All that equipped him well with knowledge and skills to start his infosec career almost 10 years ago. Now a senior consultant with the product security team at F-Secure Consulting, he provides advice on security topics to tier-1 automotive, aerospace, maritime, and industrial customers worldwide.</p> <p>2. ImproHound Workshop: Protect your Domain Admins with tiering<br/>It is not viable for system administrators and defenders in a large Active Directory (AD) environment to ensure all AD objects have only the exact permissions they need. It is too big of a task, why many organizations are vulnerable to AD attacks due to too loose or wrong permissions. At the same time, credential theft may lead to privileges AD users having their password stolen when they login to compromised computers. These vulnerabilities are chainable, why you in many AD environments can escalate your rights to Domain Admin no matter what computer or user you have.</p> <p>Microsoft realised this issue, and recommended organizations to implement the AD tier model: Split the AD into three tiers and focus on preventing attack paths leading from one tier to a more business critical tier. The concept is great, but it turns out to be rather difficult to implement the tiering concept in AD, why most organizations fail it and end up leaving security gaps..</p> <p>After this workshop, you will be able to help those organizations! And probably p0wn them..<br/>The workshop is part talk and part workshop and you will need to bring a computer with VMWare/VirtualBox to try out ImproHound. Experience with Active Directory is an advantage, but not a requirement.</p> <p>Jonas B\u00fclow Knudsen is an Active Directory (AD) security advisor. Jonas has spent the past two years helping organizations implement technical countermeasures and remediate vulnerabilities in and around AD, including implementation of the AD tier model. Working closely together with penetration testers and having a strong interest in offensive security enables Jonas to focus on security measures that matter and not just best practice.</p> "

Those URLs can be found in spam emails and forums, received via messaging apps or manually misspelled in the address bar. Although being a simple idea, typosquatting goes hand-in-hand with (spear)phishing attacks that evolved and became more efficient and harder to detect. We will analyze some tools for discovering typo squatted websites and potential malicious domains that can target our organisation or product.</p> <p># Bio<br/>Matej works as a Frontend Developer in Barrage. Besides the passion for frontend, he is interested in AppSec, often can be found poking around TryHackMe or in his room making lazy bash scripts that sometimes save 15 seconds of his life.</p> <p>------------------<br/>Miroslav \u0160tampar: ECSC (European Cyber Security Challenge)</p> <p># Summary<br/>As a member of the organization, the speaker would like to talk about the European Cyber Security Challenge, an annual event for young cyber security talents across Europe, powered by the EU Agency for Cybersecurity. This year is taking place in Prague, Czech Republic, from 28 September to 1st October, therefore first-hand impressions will be presented, gathered at the venue. Joint national goal should be the gathering, training and sending of the young Croatian cyber security team to a competition in the not so distant future.</p> <p># Bio<br/>Miroslav Stampar is an information security expert who lives and works in Zagreb. His scientific and professional interests include research and development of systems from the vast domain of information security. He has given talks at numerous domestic and international expert conventions on information security and programming. He is author of several world-renowned free and open source applications (sqlmap, Maltrail, etc.) In free time, an active CTF player, member of an international top-tier team Super Guesser.</p> "

Penetration test simulates the attack performed internally or externally by the attackers which have the intention to find security weaknesses or vulnerabilities and validate the potential impacts and risks should those vulnerabilities being exploited.</p> <p>Security issues found through penetration test are presented to the system\u2019s owner, data owner or risk owner. An effective penetration test will support this information with an accurate assessment of the potential impacts to the organization and range of technical and procedural safeguards should be planned and executed to mitigate risks.</p> <p>Many penetration testers are in fact very good in technical since they have skills needed to perform all of the tests, but they are lack of report writing methodology and approach which create a very big gap in penetration testing cycle. A penetration test is useless without something tangible to give to a client or senior management. Report writing is a crucial part of any service providers (eq. IT service/advisory). A report should detail the outcome of the test and, if you are making recommendations, document the recommendations to secure any high-risk systems.</p> <p>The target audience of a penetration testing report will vary, the technical report will be read by IT or any responsible information security people while executive summary will definitely be read by the senior management.<br/>Writing an effective penetration testing report is an art that needs to be learned and to make sure that the report will deliver the right information to the targeted audience.<br/>After reading the book, you will be able to: understand on how to create a good and effective penetration testing report; understand the mechanism to provide effective deliverables; apply risk management knowledge &amp; skills and blend them in your deliverables.<br/>---<br/>Short bio :</p> <p>Semi Yulianto<br/>BSc.

Similarly, CSA's IoT Working group is dedicated to understanding IoT deployments and defining actionable guidance to secure ecosystems. Their efforts are often used to develop medical security guidelines for developers and manufacturers alike but also to influence IoT security assessment methodologies for later use on commercial IoT certification schemes. This session will provide insights into current project initiatives, including those that directly impact medical devices and how you can save lives by getting involved.</p> <p>BIO: Aaron Guzman is a published author and a technical reviewer for several security books. He is the Head of Product &amp; Application Security with Cisco Meraki where he focuses on building security into enterprise IoT products and crafting designs that keep users safe from compromise. Aaron spearheads many open-source initiatives, raising awareness about IoT hacking and proactive defensive strategies under OWASP\u2019s IoT and Embedded Application Security projects. A co-chair of Cloud Security Alliance\u2019s IoT Working Group, he has extensive public speaking experience delivering conference presentations, training, and workshops globally.

Static activities have context and depth, but lack visibility on the true behavior of the software. On the other hand, runtime activities have no direct access to the internals of the application because they follow an external approach.</p> <p>DevOps teams are demanding a more complete picture of the security of the applications, combining static and dynamic activities. In this practical talk, I want to propose a new approach based on runtime observability, that provides not only vulnerabilities and attacks, but also app deployment intelligence, sensitive data visibility, and API discovery capabilities.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Daniel Blazquez leads the technical marketing and developer advocacy practice at Hdiv Security, a VC-funded application security company focused on application security automation. As an ex-Java programmer and recovering corporate strategy professional, Daniel brings a holistic view to the S-SDLC practice: from coding to product management, all the way to growth strategy.

        "description": "<p>Code analysis is the process of analyzing the code of a program to find security vulnerabilities. It is the most effective way to identify many types of security issues, from injection vulnerabilities to issues like leaked secrets and vulnerable dependencies. But the process of manually analyzing code for vulnerabilities can be very time-consuming. Is there a better way to do this?</p> <p>In this talk, Vickie and Suchakra will demonstrate how to use open-sourced code analysis tool Joern to make code analysis more efficient. How do you effectively trace user input in code? How can you efficiently link bug sources to sensitive sink functions? This is the second edition of How to analyze code for vulnerabilities (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8CNysN-lOM\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8CNysN-lOM</a>), this time, we\u2019ll talk about how to do it efficiently using Joern.</p> <p>VICKIE LI<br/>Vickie Li is the resident developer evangelist at ShiftLeft. She is an experienced web developer with an avid interest in security research. She can be found on <a href=\"https://vickieli.dev\" class=\"linkified\">https://vickieli.dev</a>, where she blogs about security news, techniques, and her latest bug bounty findings. She also hosts \u201cSecurity Simplified\u201d, a developer education series focusing on web security: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/vickielidev\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/c/vickielidev</a>.</p> <p>SUCHAKRA SHARMA<br/>Suchakra Sharma is Staff Scientist at ShiftLeft Inc. where he builds code analysis tools and hunts security bugs. He completed his Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al where he worked on eBPF technology and hardware-assisted tracing techniques for OS analysis. As part of his research, he also developed one of the first hardware-trace based virtual machine analysis techniques. He has delivered talks and trainings at venues such as RSA, USENIX LISA, SCALE, Papers We Love, Tracing Summit, etc. When not playing with computers, he hikes and writes poems.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Whether you're an elite security researcher or just starting out in security, odds are that you're terrible at effectively explaining vulnerabilities. Sorry, that's just a fact.</p> <p>It's hard to find security vulnerabilities, but it's really difficult to establish trust, clearly and concisely explain the risk, and compel action all while being great to work with and not bruising any egos.</p> <p>You have to be a great team player and absolutely resist the urge to blame. Otherwise you'll undermine your entire security program and culture -- which is really the whole point of finding vulnerabilities in the first place.</p> <p>So, in this talk, I'm going to share the approach I developed over 15 years of consulting with the world\u2019s largest companies. With some practice, you should be able to create a fantastic, compelling vulnerability writeup in less than five minutes.</p> <p>Of course, you have to really understand the vulnerability first, but that's not what this paper is about. This is about what you do after you find something awesome.</p> <p>JEFF WILLIAMS<br/>Jeff brings more than 20 years of security leadership experience as co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Contrast Security.
