Including security controls in applications sometimes may be considered an overhead. However, if security controls are not added to applications during development, it may be challenging to add them later on. In this presentation, we will see how code can be written insecurely and really how simple it is to include the required security controls in the application.\n\nShruti is a cyber security / enterprise security architect with experience in ISO27001, PCI-DSS, policies, standards, security tools, threat modelling, risk assessments. Shruti works on security strategies and collaborates with cross-functional groups to implement information security controls in software development life-cycle, service operations, service delivery such that security controls support business requirements.\n\n**Ross Brown of the SWCRC (South West Cyber Resilience Centre)**\nI am a retired Detective officer who during my service carried out numerous roles, although primarily operating within mainstream Criminal investigations. As a trainer with Dorset Police I led a team who implemented training for a new force wide Records Management System as well as devising and writing the supervisors course. During a number of career breaks I have experience of running large scale engineering projects in the middle east.\n\nI joined the South West Cyber Resilience Centre as a Detective Inspector and head of cyber and innovation and served in that post until my retirement. I have subsequently taken on the same role as a member of Police staff.\n\nThe Cyber Resilience Centre for the South West supports and helps protect SMEs and supply chain businesses and third sector organisations in the region against cyber crime.\nWorking with local Universities and Police forces in the South West provides access to the latest local as well as national information on emerging cyber threats, criminal trends, best practice for cyber resilience and new technology to provide timely advice to prepare and protect business.\n\n**James Walsh**\nJames Walsh of Hays recruitment will be giving us an insight into the latest salary guide for the cyber security industry.\n\n**Dylan Collins**\n\"A system's biggest vulnerability is the user. With frequent software patches becoming more and more necessary to maintain security standards, does the urge to protect a system actually make people more exposed? Na\u00efve users jumping at sudden update prompts may be jumping through hoops for an attacker.\" - A research question from local software developer, Dylan Collins.\n\n**Event and Venue**\nWe will be joining Hays Recruitment in Bournemouth for this event, there is a limit on numbers, so signup is essential.

This talk delves into the sophisticated technologies behind the creation of these deceptive videos and images. We\u2019ll explore cutting-edge methods for detecting such manipulations, ensuring the authenticity of digital content. However, as detection techniques advance, so too do evasion strategies, including adversarial attacks and prompt injection methods.

In this presentation we highlight the risks of staying with the ancient (roughly 2019-2021) \u201ccurrent\u201d best practices. The current (circa 2022) BCPs bring many changes, such as deprecation of the implicit flow, required usage of PKCE and the BFF pattern which mitigates some of the previous attack vectors. It takes time for new concepts to fully mature and secure defaults emerge. While following the latest BCPs it\u2019s still possible to make mistakes and end up with a broken implementation. This presentation will show some common OAuth2/OIDC security pitfalls and why it is bad practice to use reverse proxy catch-all routing in your BFF, an OAuth2 client with access to many scopes, together with APIs that do authorization based on just a valid token and scopes. Does your BFF enable authenticated SSRF as a Service? During the presentation we will demonstrate both attacks and defences for a OAuth2/OIDC application running locally.\n**Pontus Hanssen** in an experienced security researcher and penetration tester.

The titles of the stories are:\n\u201cThe omnipotent client cert\u201d (automotive app), \u201cNext level XSS\u201c (web),\nNo route to boat\u201d (network), and \u201dHaving a conversation with a door\nhandle\" (embedded).\n**Emilie Barse** is an experienced IT security consultant with a deep\ninterest in security testing and log analysis.

Please note that all our events are live-streamed on YouTube for the online audience. Recordings will be available on the OWASP London YouTube channel.**\n\n**Venue Location**: Thought Machine, 7 Herbrand St, London WC1N 1EX\n**Nearest Tube:** Russell Square (Piccadilly Line) - 2 min walk\n**Doors Open at 6pm** for registration, pizza, drinks and networking. The talks start at 6:30pm (we start on time).\n\n**TALKS**\n\n**OWASP Introduction, Welcome and News** \\- Sam Stepanyan\n\n**\"E2E Detection Testing\"** \\- George Gilligan\n\nHow do you make sure your detections work in a cloud native organisation? Software engineers have integration tests, reliability engineers have chaos engineering frameworks. Detection engineers lack an equivalent standardised approach to E2E testing. A natural approach is a binary that generates a suspicious event, validates that a suitable alert is generated in your SIEM, closes it, and reports the result. An open source Datadog tool named Threatest does just this. We are working on extending this to work with Elasticsearch, with the hope of automating a huge portion of the work of the red team, and providing constant validation for our detections.\n\n**\"5 Open Source Security Tools All Developers Should Know About\"** \\- Raz Probstein\n\nThe minimum viable security (MVS) approach, enables us to easily bake security into our config files, apps, and CI/CD processes with a few simple controls - and the great part? It\u2019s easily achievable through open-source tooling. In this talk we will focus on five critical security controls that will be integrated as part of the CI/CD pipeline by leveraging some excellent open source tools in addition to custom controls to ensure proper enforcement of MFA via Github Security. These controls will provide a foundational framework for securing your applications from the first line of code, which will make it possible to continuously iterate and evolve your security maturity all the way through advanced layers of security that come with time, as well as increased experience with your deployments, stacks, and security posture. Code examples & demos will be showcased as part of this session.\n\n**Christmas Raffle** \\- some prizes to be won\\!\n\n**SPEAKERS**\n\n**George Gilligan (@ggilligan12)**\nGeorge Gilligan is a security engineer at Thought Machine, where his work includes securing Kubernetes clusters, container security, intrusion detection, security testing, and implementing security policies. George participates in various CTF competitions and his CTF achievements include the Deloitte CTF Qualifier, Scottish Universities Cybersecurity Challenge and Hack Harvard 2018.\nGeorge holds an Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification and a BSc (Honours) degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Edinburg. George is now studying part-time for a MSc in Software and Systems Security at the University of Oxford.\n\n**Raz Probstein (@RazProbstein)**\nRaz comes with years of experience in both leadership and technology, having served not only as Young Ambassador to the state of Israel, as well as headhunted and selected as Young Researcher at the prestigious Weizmann Institute for multi-disciplinary scientific research. Today she serves as a Solution Engineer at Jit, coming to the role with years of experience as a FullStack Engineer and years of experience in a diversity of programming languages from Python, to Javascript and C/C#, from the elite IDF unit 81 - where she was not only one of a handful of women serving in a cybersecurity role, she also mentored women to help drive more gender diversity in the unit. Today she is studying Biotechnology at the Open University, and is passionate about building cloud native security tooling developers will love\n\n**TICKETS**\nThis event is free to attend for both members and non-members of OWASP and is open to anyone interested in web application and cyber security. Please note that you MUST book your place to be admitted to the event by the building security - your name will be checked against the guest list.\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone. Please reach out to one of our chapter leaders if you have any feedback/concerns or would like to speak to us, we take these matters very seriously.

        "description": "**There is a dark side to productivity with open source. In modern applications, the majority of code on which an application is built isn\u2019t code written by your team. Modern applications are built on the backs of volunteer communities and open-source software. These volunteers and their software delivery practices all become potential attack vectors.**\n\n**The truth is that most organizations do not factor open-source supply chain attacks into their organization\u2019s threat models today. Security incidents such as the CodeCov bash uploader script, the npm colors, and faker intentionally introduced malicious commits, and the recent PyPi backdoors targeting AWS credentials highlight the impact of supply chain attacks as a scalable attack pattern. To spread awareness on supply chain attacks so that organizations can scalably handle them we propose baking supply chain attacks into existing threat modeling procedures and software development culture so that organizations can champion supply chain management of open source in the places where they are most impactful, at development time.**\n\n**We will present a comprehensive, comprehensible, and technology-agnostic taxonomy of attack vectors, created on the basis of hundreds of real-world incidents and validated by experts in the domain. Following, we will discuss the types of defenses you can put in place to detect and respond to such modern day attacks and how you can work these defenses in based on your program\u2019s maturity.**"

With the banking industry implementing new measures, such that restricting users from having certain applications on their devices which they use for sensitive transactions, we explore if these are viable solutions or just a stop-gap measure until the next round of attacks show up on victim's devices.\n\nThis presentation delves into the intricate landscape of advanced mobile security attacks that pose significant risks to mobile platforms. We explore the evolving nature of mobile malware, emphasizing the need for proactive measures to fortify applications against advanced attacks.\n\n**1st Presenter**: Pishu Mahtani, Ex-DART\n\n**Second topic**: \"Understanding API Security problems\"\n\n**Synopsis**: It\u2019s no surprise that API adoption is growing rapidly. The reality is that new business innovation and services are powered by APIs. But the rush to innovate is leaving security teams struggling to understand the very real security risks that APIs pose. Today, APIs carry vast amounts of data and are increasingly targets in data breaches.\n\nThis talk delves into common API security concerns and the importance of API Discovery. It highlights the key needs for an API security tool to detect API abuses and the importance of having a data lake for threat hunting.\n\n**2nd Presenter**: Chao Yin Loong, Senior Solutions Engineer at Akamai Technologies\n\nMany thanks to Akamai for sponsoring the venue and pizzas! Come early, enjoy free pizzas and inter-mingle with AppSec enthusiasts."

        "description": "Hi all, we are delighted to host the next in-person event in Frankfurt! This time we have a special focus on GenAI security, where will we have a range of talks delivered by leaders within the AI security space. There will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event.\n\n_What's going to happen?\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our OWASP Frankfurt Meetup with a strong focus in Security in Generative AI hosted by **CHECK24**.\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n**Talk 1 - The Dark Side Of Large Language Models: Uncovering And Overcoming Of Code Vulnerabilities**\n\n*Javan Rasokat* *\\- Senior Security Specialist at Sage\\, Researcher and Lecturer at DHBW\\, Germany*\n\nIn his talk, Javan will discuss the role of large language models in cybersecurity, highlighting both their potential and pitfalls. Using GitHub Copilot as a case study, he'll emphasize the importance of secure coding practices and manual code reviews in AI-driven development.\n\n**Talk 2 - Seeing is Not Always Believing: The Rise, Detection, and Evasion of Deepfakes**\n\n*Niklas Bunzel, PhD student at TU-Darmstadt and research scientist at Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (SIT) and the National Research Centre for Applied Cybersecurity - ATHENE*\n\n*Raphael Antonius Frick, research fellow at Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (SIT) and the National Research Centre for Applied Cybersecurity - ATHENE*\n\nIn an era where digital information dominates, the saying \u201cseeing is believing\u201d has been cast into doubt with the emergence of deepfakes \u2014 AI-generated media that manipulates reality. This talk delves into the sophisticated technologies behind the creation of these deceptive videos and images. We\u2019ll explore cutting-edge methods for detecting such manipulations, ensuring the authenticity of digital content. However, as detection techniques advance, so too do evasion strategies, including adversarial attacks and prompt injection methods. This poses the question: Can we still believe everything that we see?\n\n_Afterwards?\nWe will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility of **socializing** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **CHECK24**.\n\n_When?\nOur Meetup takes place on 29.11.2023 from 18.00 to 21.30 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nCHECK24 Frankfurt is located at Speicherstra\u00dfe 55 in Frankfurt am Main, ca. 15min within walking distance of Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nSubmit your talk here: https://www.papercall.io/owasp-chapter-frankfurt\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word,** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"
