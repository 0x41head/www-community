        "description": "OWASP Aarhus and Danske Commodities are happy to invite you to this OWASP Aarhus meetup.\n\n19:00 \u2013 19:05 Welcome by Tobias Evar Lauridsen, Danske Commodities, and Thomas Ljungberg Kristensen, OWASP Aarhus\n\n19:05 \u2013 20:00 Frans aims to facilitate a case study centered around a simulated security breach, where participants will navigate a company through a security incident, emphasizing the management of employees, customers, authorities, and other stakeholders. This exercise will simulate a scenario where the participants must effectively handle the aftermath of a security breach, addressing concerns related to internal personnel, external clients, regulatory bodies, and other relevant stakeholders.\n\nThrough this simulation, Frans aims to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved and enable participants to apply effective strategies in real-world scenarios\n\nAbout Frans: Frans Skovholm is an attorney and partner at DAHL Law Partnership, responsible for DAHL's compliance team, which includes specialists in NIS2, ISMS, and Commercial compliance. Frans specializes in systematic risk management and advisory services related to ISMS management systems, including ISO 27001. He holds certification as an ISO 27001 Lead Implementer from PECB, which he applies in his consultation on information security law. Furthermore, he engages in work related to data protection law, assisting numerous companies in implementing internal regulations to ensure compliance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\n20:00 \u2013 20:30 Networking break\n\n20:30 \u2013 21:25 Overcoming the DevSecOps Imposter Syndrome by Michael Man, DevSecOps Evangelist and Community Leader, Veracode\n\nThe technology landscape is forever changing, and this is also reflective within the security field. As such, it is very overwhelming for people trying to break into the security domain and it is no difference for people who works in it. In this talk, I will share my perspective with how I had tackled this problem, how I drowned in the tsunami of information which impacted me mentally and tips for you to consider taking your first steps with your Continuous Learning journey.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\\- Admit to yourself that nobody knows it all\n\\- Be brave and ask those questions \\(others will be thankful\\)\n\\- Do not let the opinionated people overwhelm you\n\\- Techniques I use as part of my Continuous Learning\n\nAbout Michael: Michael brings more than 20 years of IT security experience. He has advised large enterprises on secure software development, working across all stages of delivery, while engaging with the different stakeholders to deliver successful business outcomes. His favourite certification is his OSCP due to his keen understanding of ethical hacking practices. Michael is also the founder of one of the largest DevSecOps community meetups \u201cDevSecOps - London Gathering\u201d and has co-organised the conference \u201cDevSecOps Days London\u201d.\n\n21:15 \u2013 21:30 Closing notes and goodbyes"

Matthias will present useful insights on his research and privacy implications on several aspects of facial recognition. Both talks will be held in English.\n\nDoors are open on 18:00 CEST on and we will begin with the presentations at 18:30 CEST!\n\n**In a nutshell**\nLocation: Strandkai 1, 20457 Hamburg\nStart: Doors open @ 6:00 CEST, February 7th. 6:30 pm sharp start the talks\nTitle: *A beginner's guide to SSO (mis)configuration* by Adina Bogert-O'Brien\nTitle: *Omnipresent Biometric Surveillance* by Matthias Marx\nNetworking: Stay there or depending on our mood we'll have an after-talk beer somewhere in the vicinity of the venue\n\n**Abstract: A beginner's guide to SSO (mis)configuration**\nSSO is sold as a way to\n\n* centralize managing your organization\u2019s users,\n* make life easier for your colleagues, and\n* enforce consistent security standards.\n\nBut SSO protocols are just ways for an identity provider to share information about an authenticated identity with another service. Me having a way to tell my vendor \u201cyeah, that\u2019s Bob\u201d doesn\u2019t tell me what the vendor does with this information, or if the vendor always asks me who\u2019s coming in the door.\nA bad SSO implementation can make you think you\u2019re safer, while hiding all the new and fun things that have gone wrong.\nTo get the most out of implementing SSO, I need to know what I\u2019m trying to accomplish and what steps I need to follow to get there. To illustrate why SSO needs to be set up carefully, for each of the things you need to do right, I\u2019ll give you some fun examples of creative ways you and your vendor can do this wrong. We all learn from failure, right???\nI\u2019m sharing this info because this year I got deeply involved in the SSO setup for several vendors at work. It turns out that I\u2019m good at asking weird questions, and it\u2019s an extremely valuable thing to do. If you know how things should be, then you know where they could be broken, and you can ask your vendors (and your colleagues!) \u201cweird questions\u201d before an adversary does.\nI'm especially interested in what the OWASP Hamburg group has to say about these misconfigurations: how does OWASP documentation cover things like this?\n\n**Abstract: Omnipresent Biometric Surveillance**\nBiometric surveillance is ever-present in Germany and many of us have not realized this. Facial recognition search engines like Clearview AI and Pimeyes feed our faces to their gigantic search indexes without our explicit consent. Matthias shares his experiences attempting to uphold privacy through GDPR, shedding light on the associated challenges.\n\n**Our OWASP \"Stammtisch\"**\nOur meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pen testers and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information. Feel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too. Participation is free and open -- as the O in OWASP.\n\nCheers, Dirk & Bj\u00f6rn"

The presentation offers in-depth examples, particularly focusing on \"social engineering\" methods, to illustrate the techniques and consequences of these security breaches.\n\n 19:15 to 19:45 - Top 5 Open Source Tools All Developers Should Know About!\n\nRaz Probstein - Solution Engineer @ Jit\n\nThe Minimum Viable Security (MVS) approach simplifies the integration of security measures into config files, apps, and CI/CD processes using open source tools. This talk focuses on incorporating five key security controls into the CI/CD pipeline, utilizing tools like Bandit, Gitleaks, OSV-Scanner, KICS, and OWASP\u2019s ZAP. These controls, along with custom measures for enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication via Github Security, establish a foundational security framework from the initial code, allowing continuous improvement as applications evolve over time. Code examples and demos will be presented in the session.\n\n 19:45 - 20:15 - Recent Supply Chain Code Attacks\n\nYoad Fekete - Co-Founder & CEO @ Myrror Security\n\nJoin us for a deep-dive into the world of recent software supply chain attacks and how to defend against them.\nIn this lecture, we will discuss the difference between a supply chain attack and a vulnerability, and explore why there has been a significant increase in these types of attacks in the past couple of years.\nWe will showcase various vectors for these attacks with recent attacks examples.\nThe highlight? A technical demo of an attack, similar to the UA-Parser/Ledger Connect kit malicious package attacks.\n\n=====================================================================\n\nThis event is sponsored by Bright Security in collaboration with OWASP Israel.\n\nJoin us at the event physically as we will not include Zoom or remote participation this time."

Originally written by Ivan Risti\u0107, it was acquired by Trustwave and then developed for over 10 years by Trustwave\u2019s SpiderLabs.\n\nModSecurity exists as a module for the Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, and IIS (v2) and it has also been released as standalone daemon for NGINX (v3), accessible via an API and a webserver specific connector module. It is able to inspect HTTP requests and HTTP responses and it configured via rules in a rather cumbersome config language called \u201cSecLang\u201d. OWASP CRS is the dominant rules project used by most ModSecurity users.\n\nIn 2021, Trustwave announced the end of support and the plan to hand over ModSecurity into the hands of the community by Summer 2024. OWASP tried to convince Trustwave to hand it over to the foundation several times, but only succeeded in November 2023. A plan was thus drawn and a new project was prepared from December 2023. The main repository was transferred on January 25 and OWASP ModSecurity was declared a \u201cproduction level\u201d OWASP project by the OWASP project committee.\n\nThe new project operates with a preliminary leader team, the first release is already out and the community is growing, all in line with the 3-6 month project plan drawn up in December 2023.\n\nThis talk gives an overview of this dynamics at play, how OWASP operates on projects like this and the perspectives are for ModSecurity and OWASP as a whole.\n\n*Bio:*\nDr. Christian Folini is a Swiss security engineer and open source enthusiast. He brings 15 years of experience with ModSecurity configuration in high security environments, DDoS defense and threat modeling. Christian Folini is the author of the 2nd edition of the ModSecurity Handbook and the best known teacher on the subject. He co-leads the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set project and serves as the program chair of the \u201cSwiss Cyber Storm\u201d conference.\n\n**OWASP Dependency-Track**\n*Abstract:*\nSince its inception over a decade ago, OWASP Dependency-Track has pioneered many concepts in the realm of software supply chain security, and software bill of materials (SBOM).\n\nWith increasingly more governments, regulators and organizations asking for SBOMs, the project is more relevant than ever. On the other hand, a non-negligible portion of folks is still puzzled as to what to even do with SBOMs once they have them.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll explore what Dependency-Track is, how it can help organizations in identifying and reducing risk in their software supply chain, and give an outlook into what\u2019s next!\n\n*Bio:*\nAfter years as Security Engineer for a large European payment service provider, Niklas currently works as Cloud Native Engineer for ControlPlane. He is passionate about AppSec, DevSecOps and Open Source. He co-leads the OWASP Dependency-Track project and is a contributor to the OWASP CycloneDX Bill of Materials standard, for which he maintains the official Go tooling."

Introduction to OWASP Ottawa, Public Announcements.\n2. **Kubernetes Is Insecure by Default and What You Can Do About It**\n\n**Abstract:**\nWe tend to build things that are insecure by default. Kubernetes is no different. To be clear, this isn\u2019t a value judgment. Kubernetes is an amazing open-source project made up of the contributions of thousands of people. Why Kubernetes is the way it is by default makes sense\u2014we want it to be as easy to use as possible to start. As well, there were particular design decisions made that impact how we think about security in Kubernetes. Unfortunately, security is a trade-off, and ultimately, we need to undo the insecure by default stance and implement some level of security. But at what level? What changes? And where? In this talk, we\u2019ll discuss three major areas where we can make some positive security trade-offs to vastly improve the baseline level of security in Kubernetes without overly affecting ease of use or user expectations; a way that we can create a new baseline to build on. This talk would demo setting up open source automation to configure Kubernetes to have a default level of security, as well as using Falco for threat detection as a last line of defence.\n\n**Speaker:**\nCurtis Collicutt works to make complicated software and systems safer and easier to use. He has spent his career managing complex infrastructure and applications, working to make them reliable and secure through the principles of automation and organisational models such as DevOps. Curtis approaches his work from a socio-technical perspective, believing that it's not just about what technology can do, but how we use it, and that we'll be both safer and more productive if we approach difficult problems like cybersecurity through a human-centric lens. Currently he works at Sysdig helping customers achieve cybersecurity outcomes."
