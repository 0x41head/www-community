Courtesy our sponsors JIT (https://www.jit.io).\n\nThis is a joint meetup with Pacific hackers community (https://www.phack.org/)\n\n*Jit*\\- An open DevSecOps Orchestration Platform allows high\\-velocity Engineering teams to own product security while increasing dev velocity\\.\n\n5PM to 5.45PM Networking, food/Drinks\n5.45 PM to 8 PM Talks\n\n**Talk #1: \"Securing a cloud app: from threat modeling to Continuous Security\"**\n(basically I am doing is an extended talk based on the MVS one for Python apps)\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn this presentation, we will delve into the process of securing a cloud hosted application, using a Python-based app as our demonstrative model, from scratch. Our initial focus is on the initial crucial step of threat modeling, demystifying the process for beginners and offering a deep-dive into the identification, analysis, and prioritization of potential security risks across the codebase, infrastructure, CI/CD pipeline, and runtime.\n\nFurther, we will explore how these identified risks can be mapped to security tools using open-source security (OSS) tools, including some developed by OWASP.\n\nThe final part of our journey takes us through the seamless integration of these tools into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Utilizing Github Actions as a case study, we will show how to build and automate a security-focused workflow, ensuring a constantly secure state for your application.\n\nBy attending this session, you'll gain practical insights and tools to build secure cloud applications, maintain an efficient CI/CD pipeline, and tackle the dynamic cyber threat landscape with confidence and foresight. Stay a step ahead in your application security with continuous and integrated security measures.\n\n**Speaker:** David Melamed CTO JIT\n\n**Talks #2: Unlock Your AppSec Career Potential: A Guide to Successful career**\nDescription:\nRapid development cycles and time constraints, diverse skill sets required to evaluate applications built with complex new technologies, evolving threat landscape are some of the reasons that make application security engineer\u2019s job interesting and difficult at the same time. As a result appsec engineers have to develop fast learning mechanisms and based on their strengths and interest, pick the right career paths to not just survive but thrive in the world of application security. In this talk, we will discuss how to analyze one\u2019s strengths and interests and choose the right application security career path and continue to prosper throughout your career.\n\nSpeaker: Trupti Shiralkar, Sr Manager Product Security at Datadog and Deidre Diamond Founder CyberSN\n\n**Talk #3: Winning Others Over, Cross-Functional Collaboration in Cybersecurity**\n\nWhether we\u2019re an extrovert, ambivert, or introvert, the majority of us work with people. Even when we write or review code most of the day, we still receive and provide feedback. In cybersecurity, a large portion of success relies on your ability to win others over. How do you convince developers to write secure code or care about it? How do you work with HR/People to educate new and existing employees about security practices? How do you collaborate with product, program, and project teams to build, deploy, or review? How do we incorporate the OWASP Top 10 into our work and communicate those vulnerabilities and their importance to other teams? Solid documentation is a hallmark of cybersecurity work and an aspect of WOO, but there's more to it. In this presentation, we\u2019ll discuss ways to work cross-functionally and win others over. Methods will be presented for all personality types, and participants will have examples that can be applied in their workplaces.\n\nSpeaker: Kelly Thibault is the Executive Director at Secure Diversity, a non-profit focused on diversity in cybersecurity. In her job, she runs the Day of Shecurity Conference and partners with cybersecurity professionals of all levels. She has spent over 15 years running programs, managing risk and crisis response, leading people, and working cross-functionally. She loves learning, wearing multiple hats, and building relationships. She attributes much of her success in building and problem-solving to her ability to make connections and build work relationships."

However, this innovation is not without inherent risks. One potential issue is that these models generate code with hardcoded secrets, such as API keys or database credentials. This practice stands in stark contrast to the recommended way of managing these secrets \u2013 through a secrets manager.\n\nIn this presentation, we consider the following:\n\\- What are hardcoded secrets and how to prevent them\n\\- The importance of secrets management\n\\- The impact of LLMs in generating code\n\\- How to mitigate the risk of hardcoded secrets in code generated by LLM\n\nThis will be an exciting session, RSVP now!"

How to Deploy it\nJoin us for great networking, dinner and drinks, and see a presentation by President and Founder of iSecurePrivacy, LLC.\n\n**ABSTRACT**: Security Architecture is a security design that addresses the technology goals, approaches, controls, and potential for the enterprise. It also specifies when and where to apply security controls. This discussion starts from the enterprise perspective using SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture). It then introduces COBIT, from ISACA, which is a framework that focuses on the governance and management of enterprise IT. TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) aligns security with business needs. Then there is the OWASP SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model) that is a framework for helping organizations analyze their current software security practices in the development of new applications. Within these four security architectures, we will also talk about some software secure coding standards such as (PCI Software Security Framework, SEI CERT Coding Standards, NIST SSDF, Microsoft Secure Coding Guidelines , and OWASP Secure Coding Practices). These standards are important, but they need to be based on meeting the business strategic objectives, business model, and business needs. That is what security architectures provide.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: *[Prisma Cloud](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud)*\n*The Most Complete Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP). Prisma Cloud secures applications from code to cloud, enabling security and DevOps teams to effectively collaborate to accelerate secure cloud-native application development and deployment.*\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available**\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

Build your app, attack other's apps, and iterate on improving your defences.\n\nHow will this work?\n\nThis is a battle challenge. You have limited time to address the security vulnerabilities in your code. Once you push your code, you enter the battle page where you can hack other players app. Anytime you successfully hack a player's app, you need to extract the flag. You then submit the flag to get the score. The earlier you defend your app or hack another player's, the higher will be your ranking.\n\nNOTE: If a player hacks your app, you will lose the score and get kicked out of the battle page. You may try again.\n\nNo presentation, no lecture. This is a hands-on session to up-skill in secure programming. Please bring your laptop with your development environment set up and ready to go, so that you can jump right into the action.\n\n**We will explore these weaknesses**:\n\n* CWE-35 and CWE-23\n\n**Agenda**:\n\n* 6:00-6:10 Welcome\n* 6:10-7:30 Let the battle begin.\n\nThis event is not catered, but you're welcomed to bring your own food along.\n\n**Prepare**:\nIf you are a first timer, **get your workstation setup** by completing any of the \"Start Here\" levels on [https://play.secdim.com](https://play.secdim.com/) (SecDim Play is a training game for secure programming)\n\n**Contribute**: Help to foster the community by **contributing a secure programming challenge**.

Metamorphic Testing for Web System Security.\n\n**Abstract:**\nSecurity testing aims at verifying that the software meets its security properties. In modern Web systems, however, this often entails the verification of the outputs generated when exercising the system with a very large set of inputs. Full automation is thus required to lower costs and increase the effectiveness of security testing.\n\nUnfortunately, to achieve such automation, in addition to strategies for automatically deriving test inputs, we need to address the oracle problem, which refers to the challenge, given an input for a system, of distinguishing correct from incorrect behavior (e.g., the response to be received after a specific HTTP GET request).\n\nIn this presentation, we propose Metamorphic Security Testing for Web-interactions (MST-wi), a metamorphic testing approach that integrates test input generation strategies inspired by mutational fuzzing and alleviates the oracle problem in security testing. It enables engineers to specify metamorphic relations (MRs) that capture many security properties of Web systems. To facilitate the specification of such MRs, we provide a domain-specific language accompanied by an Eclipse editor. MST-wi automatically collects the input data and transforms the MRs into executable Java code to automatically perform security testing. It automatically tests Web systems to detect vulnerabilities based on the relations and collected data.\n\n**Speaker Bio:**\nNazanin Bayati is a Ph.D. candidate at the School of EECS at the University of Ottawa and a member of the Nanda Lab. She received several academic awards, including a Ph.D. admission scholarship, an international doctoral scholarship from the University of Ottawa, and an honourable award for being an outstanding student during her master\u2019s degree at the Iran University of Science and Technology. She was also ranked the best student among all computer engineering students at the Iran University of Science and Technology in 2019. Her research interests include automated software testing concerning security testing, applied data science and empirical software engineering."

One strategy that has proven to be highly effective is application modernization. This is not just a mere upgrade; it is a complete transformation of how businesses operate. By embracing this approach, companies can accelerate innovation, optimize costs, and improve their overall security posture.\n\nHowever, embarking on the journey of application modernization is not an easy task. It requires a significant investment in people, processes, and technology to achieve the desired business outcomes. The right foundation must be established from the beginning to avoid the high cost of re-architecture, which can be a major roadblock in achieving success. One crucial aspect is developing a standard and scalable security design for their Kubernetes environment. This will establish the framework for implementing the necessary checks, enforcement, and visibility to enable strategic business objectives.\n\nIn conclusion, application modernization is a strategic initiative that can transform businesses. Developing a standard and scalable security design for the Kubernetes environment is critical to establishing the framework for implementing the necessary checks, enforcement, and visibility to enable strategic business objectives.\n\n**Presenter:**\n\n**Regis Martins**\n\nRegis Martins is a passionate problem solver and technologist with a deep-rooted love for finding innovative solutions.
