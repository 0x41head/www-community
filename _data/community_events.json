She is also a speaker at Black Hat and Defcon.\n\nTalk 3#\n\nIAM for the DevSecOps Engineer\n\nIs moving security controls to earlier in the development cycle a good idea? The benefits are already well understood in the context of scanning and testing, but can IAM benefit from this as well? As it turns out \u2013 yes! \u2013 but not without its trade-offs. To paraphrase from Carl Sagan: If you wish to shift left with IAM from scratch, you must first invent the universe. When it comes to IAM, the DevSecOps engineer needs to make sure what they build is **functional**, **frictionless**, and **repeatable**. In this talk, we'll cover the challenges and technical details around what it means in practice to \"shift left\" for IAM. We'll look at Infrastructure as Code, GitOps, and how their rough edges can make you want to go back to clicking around in a web console. We'll dive into Terraform and how its concurrency, latency, and consistency nuances can make you yell at your CI/CD pipelines.\n\nBio: Jeff Chao is the Co-Founder & CTO at abbey.io, which is taking a unique approach to automating IAM via Terraform. Prior to starting Abbey, he led Change Data Capture at Stripe to make sure $640 Billion went to the right bank accounts. Before that, he was at Netflix trying to make the play button work with 100% uptime."

        "description": "We're back, on Tuesday 17th October, at Sage Bristol (near Queen Square).\n\nChris Goff will talk about \"**Secure by Design and by Default**\", and Daniel Billing has a talk on \"**Exploring Security**\".\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\n**Secure by Design and by Default**\n\nSecure by design is not a new concept. But is it typically done well? What does it mean? To what extent should software producers be required to understand how their products could present security threats to their customers, and how should they mitigate them?\nWe\u2019ll briefly explore this topic, have a discussion about what we think as cyber professionals and engineers, and have a brief look at how we could embed secure design thinking into our daily practices.\n\nChris has over 18 years of experience in technology careers. Having completed a web application development degree at Bournemouth, Chris has worked for various sizes of business, from a small software start up, to CIO for the UK\u2019s largest independent foster care agency, to working for a Big 4 consulting firm as a cybersecurity consultant. Chris is a security generalist who thrives acting as the interface between security and technology teams and the wider business. He now works for Sage, a FTSE 100 software company, as part of the security leadership team. Outside of work, Chris is a husband and father of two girls, enjoys hiking, camping, wine and folk music.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\n**Exploring Security**\n\nSecurity is a vital aspect of software development and quality. Without it, we compromise the confidentiality of data, both corporate and personal, the integrity and the availability of our products and services.\n\nUnfortunately, it is a challenge that is not fully understood, or executed on. Software engineers and leaders need to understand the risks and threats to their customers and deliverables. Sometimes these risks are deferred to tooling, consultants and internal security teams. This is often a great way of working for some organizations, but it ignores the fact that engineers need to be able to identify, fix and communicate the security risks to their products.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n* Understand the key security risks, threats and vulnerabilities to the services that they work on.\n* Understand that security is a whole team problem, which requires thought, planning and honest commitment to take on the challenge.\n* Begin to be able to explore security using a variety of methods, techniques and skills\n\nDan has been working in software testing and quality for over 20 years, in a variety of private and public sector organisations. Over the last 10 years or so he has discovered a passion for security testing and including and encouraging engineering teams to incorporate security processes and skills in their day to day work. Dan has also been a public speaker at a variety of tech and testing conferences across the Europe and the rest of the world. He has been passionately driving interest and skilling up of testers in the security space. Dan currently works at Microsoft Azure for Operators, since 2020. He lives in Bristol, with his family and dog Milo. He can often be found walking Milo around Hanham Common."

Runtime security tools don\u2019t understand SCA findings, and don\u2019t come in until production. What if you could marry SCA with runtime analysis during dev, test, and prod?\n\nIn this session, Kiran Kamity, Founder and CEO of Deepfactor, will discuss how the next generation of AppSec needs to go beyond just integrating static SCA into your CI pipeline, to analyzing insecure behaviors inside running apps and correlating that back to SCA to understand which vulnerable components are actually loaded into memory and used by your application. This new approach to AppSec will detect both known vulnerabilities/CVEs with SCA scans and unknown vulnerabilities with runtime analysis. It will then prioritize known vulnerabilities with runtime correlation of SCA findings. End result: you catch most of the key risks in your app, prioritize the key items your devs need to work on without flooding them with alerts, and remove unused components from your containers to burn down your CVE debt rapidly. And achieve the true mission of AppSec\u2026to empower engineering and security teams to create secure applications."

DevOps, DevSecOps, Agile, CI/CD pipeline, etc., and chances are you have heard these terms when discussing the software development life cycle. What do those terms mean? With the recent increasing cyber-attacks on software such as in-house developed code or software supply chain (open source software), the traditional ways of decreasing the attack surface on software applications no longer work effectively. Moreover, organizations are pressured to develop code faster and cheaper to meet customer demands. Mary will explain what DevSecOps is and how this practice is better than DevOps in security. In addition, how CI/CD fits in DevSecOps. Lastly, the popular tools are used in DevSecOps practices. She will provide the real-world experience challenges that she encountered.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: *[SAFEBASE](https://safebase.io/)*\n*SafeBase is the customer-facing Trust Center that automates B2B security reviews. Companies like LinkedIn, Asana, OpenAI, and Snyk use SafeBase to reduce security questionnaires, create a better buying experience, accelerate sales velocity, and position security as a revenue driver.*\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available** *Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to* *sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

Some of the cases we will discuss are:\n\\- Secret enumeration\\.\n\\- Accessing infrastructure through runners\\.\n\\- Public runners vs Private runners\\.\n\\- Code injection in the pipeline and supply chain\\.\n\\- GitHub commits information\\.\n\\- Secret searching in the repository\\.\nThe goal is to provide a broad view on the attack surface that can be derived from CI/CD orchestrators and their runners, as well as to show a few demos on how this can be done.\n\n*Bio:*\nMauricio Cano is a cloud pentester focused on container technologies. In particular, he focuses on the security of containers and serverless architectures. He has pentested Kubernetes clusters and serverless architectures for several multinational financial institutions. Prior to his security work, he has a background in academia and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Groningen, focused on programming language design and formal methods to ensure correctness. In his spare time, Cano enjoys reading, cooking, and solving puzzles.\n\n**Unveiling the secrets in your code: Detecting and Triaging exposed credentials at scale**\n*Abstract:*\nSecurity misconfigurations are often easy to exploit but also easy to avoid. How can we raise security awareness and at the same time prevent security misconfigurations (such as leaked credentials) from reaching production? Is there an easy way to scan, triage and follow-up on exposed secrets at enterprise scale? ABN Amro open sourced Repository Scanner and runs Repository Scanner internally at scale, exposing secrets in source code repositories and thereby raising security awareness while at the same time improving the security posture by remediating security misconfigurations.\n\n*Bio:*\nIngmar Vis has been working in CICD for 7 years. In his current role, Ingmar acts as a Product Owner for 2 teams at ABN Amro. 1 team is responsible for delivering the Secure Coding capability for all developers, the 2nd team is responsible for the infrastructure and automation of CICD tooling. Ingmar works on aspects such as Static Analysis, Software Composition Analysis, Container Security, and Secret Detection."

Yet we are from from artificial general intelligence. In many cases AI falls laughably short of its promises. Yet overblown claims of AI capability distract us from the real-world harms caused by poorly designed AI being deployed today that either doesn\u2019t work as advertised or that was designed without regard to the harms they can cause. Meanwhile, it also hides the successful AI use cases and the potential for real benefit when used responsibly. In this talk Abigail will dispel AI myths, highlight real-world benefits and harms with AI that exists today, and show how AI privacy can help protect us, and society, from these harms while building better AI. No, this will not be a talk on how to tame your AI overlord. This is Digital Self-Defense: the AI (Privacy) Edition.\n\n**Speaker Bio:**\n\nAbigail Dubiniecki is a lawyer, speaker, writer and educator specialising in privacy. She is passionate about Privacy by Design (PbD), privtech, Data Justice and Indigenous Data Sovereignty, especially in emerging tech and high-risk areas such as biotech, AI, IoT and adtech. As an independent consultant she helps clients of all sizes across a range of industries navigate and implement complex privacy and data protection regimes like GDPR and Quebec\u2019s Law 25 (Bill 64), with a focus on PbD and human-centred design. She has guest lectured at Henley Business School in the UK, OttawaU and U of T\u2019s School of Continuing Education. She\u2019s a Correspondent for Privacy Laws & Business International Report and a Forbes.com Contributor."

        "description": "Web APIs are a common glue that connect people and processes with digital systems all across the globe. Not surprisingly, Web APIs contribute more than 80% of the Internet traffic today. Given the importance of APIs, OWASP has recommended top-10 API specific security vulnerabilities (such as Broken Authentication/Authorization and Excessive Data Exposure problems) that organizations must address to strengthen their security posture. Albeit useful, these API specific vulnerabilities do not necessarily translate to the same business risks. For instance, two APIs from an organization with Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) may pose very different business risks to that organization.\n\nIn this session, we'll talk about API Risk Rating System (ARRS) that maps API specific vulnerabilities to business risks such as Legal/Contractual, Operational, Financial, Reputational and Regulatory. Similar in-principle yet different than Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), the main objective of ARRS is to prioritize API specific vulnerabilities based on their business risks. We'll describe the methodology behind the system developed using thousands of APIs that are being tracked at a global scale. We\u2019ll also share some hands-on practical scenarios.\n\nThe work presented was done by Samantha Sanchez, Jun Hee Lee, Alberto Ciconi and Baljeet Malhotra. Samantha, Jun Hee and Alberto are MSc Cybersecurity students at NYIT. Baljeet is an Adjunct Professor at NYIT, UBC, UVic, UNBC, and CEO of TeejLab Inc."
