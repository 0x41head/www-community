What continues to surprise him is the misconceptions that surface again and again about which teams should use these technologies and where they can benefit from them. David will debunk some of those myths and give us all a clearer picture on their usefulness and how and where we should be using them.\"\n\n7.00pm - Break\n7.15pm - TALK #2 \"DevSecOps with GitLab: How to embed Security within the Software Delivery Process\" with Stefania Chaplin\n\n\"Implementing DevOps can drastically improve the rate we deliver software. Organisations can go from deploying changes a few times a year to multiple times a day. What about vulnerabilities? Security is often considered an afterthought and this can have dire consequences as the world becomes increasingly reliant on software. How do we embed security into the software delivery process? Security is a quality check, there are multiple types and we need to make the software delivery experience as smooth as possible.In this session, you'll find out more about common pain points, solutions, and how to embed security within the software delivery process and secure your DevOps process.\"\n\n7.45pm - Questions/Any Other Business\n8.00pm - Close\n\n***\n\nNathan + Jim"

There will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event at the venue.\n\n_What's going to happen?\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our OWASP Frankfurt Meetup hosted by **CHECK24 Frankfurt.**\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n* _Talk 1 - \"**AI-Enhanced Application Security: A Modern Approach**\" by **Diana Waithanji**, Cybersecurity engineer at SAP.\nThis talk will discuss how AI is being used to solve application security issues. We will explore the potential benefits of using AI in this area, such as increased efficiency and effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Additionally, we will discuss some of the challenges and limitations that come with using AI in application security and how they can be addressed.\n* _Talk 2 - \"**Beyond the Checkbox: Breaking out of Testing Frameworks**\" by **Jiska Classen**, As mobile applications handle sensitive data, ensuring their security is crucial. However, simply securing individual apps is not enough to stop real-world attackers who exploit devices through other avenues. This talk will explore unconventional security testing approaches that can help improve app security by addressing vulnerabilities in the operating system, hardware, and third-party libraries. Discover how attackers can exploit wireless interfaces, sandboxing, privilege checking bypasses, and more. Let's explore why these attack vectors are relevant in practice and how to address them beyond standard security testing checklists.\n\n_Afterwards? We will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility to **socialize** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **CHECK24 Frankfurt**.\n\n_When\nOur Meetup takes place on the last Wednesday of the month in April, namely on 26.04.2023 from 18:00 to 21.00 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nCHECK24 Frankfurt is located at Speicherstra\u00dfe 55 in Frankfurt am Main, ca. 15min within walking distance of Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nGet in touch with the Frankfurt Chapter Leads (Dan Gora or Jonas Becker)\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"

What are the pitfalls and the solutions? How do we avoid that someone else\u2019s security issues become our security problems? And, by all means, let\u2019s learn how to be a bit lazy, and do better with less effort!\n*Bio:*\nCurrently working as Information Security Manager at Canon EMEA, Sebastian has been in IT and Security for over 20 years, covering a multitude of roles ranging from Developer, Security Architect, Auditor and Consultant, before moving into security governance and management, giving him a unique multi-faceted view on today\u2019s InfoSec challenges. He has led multiple security improvement programs and performed maturity assessments for a wide variety of organizations - while continuously asking himself:\"Could we do this in another way?\"\n\n**About containers and their escapes: understanding escape patterns and possibilities**\n*Abstract:*\nContainers have become one of the most common underlying infrastructure for microservice architectures. As such, they can often be part of the external attack surface of enterprise systems and applications (e.g., whenever a web application hosted on a kubernetes cluster is Internet-facing). Thus, it is important to understand what types of (mis)configurations can make containers more vulnerable against attacks of different types. In this talk, Mauricio will deep dive into different techniques that can be used to escape containers. In particular, he will talk about how to escape privileged containers, the usage of different capabilities, the usage of kernel exploits and a few other ways in which attackers may use to gain access to the hosts of the containers.\n*Bio:*\nMauricio Cano is a cloud pentester focused on container technologies. In particular, he focuses on the security of containers and serverless architectures. He has pentested Kubernetes clusters and serverless architectures for several multinational financial institutions. Prior to his security work, he has a background in academia and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Groningen, focused on programming language design and formal methods to ensure correctness. In his spare time, Cano enjoys reading, cooking, and solving puzzles."

Prior to joining IriusRisk James worked as a Security & Compliance Engineer at a consulting firm. He is a proud husband and father to two kids. James currently is an active board member in a community non-profit that focuses on revitalization and economic development of historic districts across the country.\n**Title: How to Identify Threat Modeling Limitations**\n**Abstract:**\nMany cyber and application security tools love to say they can do everything needed to protect your assets. It isn\u2019t rocket science to know that\u2019s not true. It\u2019s helpful to consider the limitations of tools and processes. This presentation will take attendees through how to define the limitations of threat modeling correctly, understand best practices in how, when, and by whom a proper threat model should be performed, and how this process of identifying threat model limitations can help users better understand its utility to systems and processes.\n\n**Speaker 2: Jonathan Marcil, NorthSec Challenge Designer**\nJonathan is a board member of the OWASP Orange County chapter. Originally from Montreal, he is part of NorthSec CTF as a challenge designer. He is passionate about Application Security and enjoys architecture analysis, code review, threat modeling and debunking security tools. Jonathan holds a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from ETS Montreal and has more than 19 years of experience in Information Technology and Security.\n**Title: AI (Stable Diffusion) CTF Workshop**\n**Abstract:**\nSurprise! We're going to dive into the marvelous world of \"artificial intelligence\" and \"prompt engineering\".\nThis session will cover two CTF challenges based on Stable Diffusion which is a model capable of generating photo-realistic images given any text input. This will allow us to show in a practical fashion some potential real impact of something otherwise artificial.\nParticipants can bring their laptop to try the challenges by themselves. If you have a gaming laptop with a dedicated graphic card, that could be handy! For the others, rest assured as we will be solving them step by step alongside diving into diffusion models and machine learning technical details.\n\n### **Code of Conduct**\n\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone. Please reach out to one of our chapter leaders if you have any feedback/concerns or would like to speak to us, we take these matters very seriously.

There will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event at the venue.\n\n_What's going to happen?\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our OWASP Frankfurt Meetup hosted by **CHECK24 Frankfurt.**\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n* _Talk 1 - \"**AI-Enhanced Application Security: A Modern Approach**\" by **Diana Waithanji**, Cybersecurity engineer at SAP.\nThis talk will discuss how AI is being used to solve application security issues. We will explore the potential benefits of using AI in this area, such as increased efficiency and effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Additionally, we will discuss some of the challenges and limitations that come with using AI in application security and how they can be addressed.\n* _Talk 2 - \"**Beyond the Checkbox: Breaking out of Testing Frameworks**\" by **Jiska Classen**, As mobile applications handle sensitive data, ensuring their security is crucial. However, simply securing individual apps is not enough to stop real-world attackers who exploit devices through other avenues. This talk will explore unconventional security testing approaches that can help improve app security by addressing vulnerabilities in the operating system, hardware, and third-party libraries. Discover how attackers can exploit wireless interfaces, sandboxing, privilege checking bypasses, and more. Let's explore why these attack vectors are relevant in practice and how to address them beyond standard security testing checklists.\n\n_Afterwards? We will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility to **socialize** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **CHECK24 Frankfurt**.\n\n_When\nOur Meetup takes place on the last Wednesday of the month in April, namely on 26.04.2023 from 18:00 to 21.00 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nCHECK24 Frankfurt is located at Speicherstra\u00dfe 55 in Frankfurt am Main, ca. 15min within walking distance of Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nGet in touch with the Frankfurt Chapter Leads (Dan Gora or Jonas Becker)\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"
