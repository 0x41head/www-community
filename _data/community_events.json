        "description": "<p>Get ready for a set of 2 new exciting talks brought by experienced speakers in the security industry!</p> <p>Talk#1: A New Class of DNS Vulnerabilities Affecting Many DNS-as-Service Platforms</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>We present a novel class of DNS vulnerabilities that affect multiple DNS-as-a-Service (DNSaaS) providers. The vulnerabilities have been proven and successfully exploited on three major cloud providers including AWS Route 53 and may affect many others. Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow exfiltration of sensitive information from service customers' corporate networks. The leaked information contains internal and external IP addresses, computer names, and sometimes NTLM / Kerberos tickets. The root cause of the problem is the non-standard implementation of DNS resolvers that, when coupled with specific unintended edge cases on the DNS service provider's side, cause major information leakage from internal corporate networks.</p> <p>In this research, we detail a specific vulnerability that is common across many major DNS service providers that leads to information leakage in connected corporate networks. Specifically, we show how Microsoft Windows endpoints reveal sensitive customer information when performing DNS update queries. The security risk is high. If an organization's DNS Updates are leaked to a malicious 3rd party, they reveal sensitive network information that can be used to map the organization and make operational goals. Internal IP addresses reveal the network segments of the organization; computer names hint at the potential content they may hold; external IP addresses expose geographical locations and the organization's sites throughout the world; and internal IPv6 addresses are sometimes accessible from the outside and allow an entry point into the organization. The impact is huge. Out of six major DNSaaS providers we examined, three were vulnerable to nameserver registration.</p> <p>Speaker: Shir Tamari, Head of Research at Wiz<br/>Shir Tamari is an experienced security and technology researcher specializing in vulnerability research and practical hacking. Shir is currently Head of Research of the cloud security company Wiz. In the past, he served as a consultant to a variety of security companies in the fields of research, development and product. Shir is also a member of the 5BC CTF team.</p> <p>Talk #2: Redefining Threat Modeling: Security team goes on vacation</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Threat Modeling is an important part of every company's Security Development Lifecycle, but as development teams grow bigger Security will either have to choose which features they want to Threat Model or they will become a bottleneck for the development organization.</p> <p>What if I told you, you can have your cake and eat it too. It is possible to scale your threat modeling program to *every* feature and you don't have to be a bottleneck to the development organization. What if I also told you that the Threat Models in this utopia are also of higher quality as well.<br/>In this utopian world, Threat Modeling is no longer the Application Security team's responsibility. The responsibility now lies with the development teams. Self-serve Threat Modeling is the way of the future.</p> <p>Speaker:- Jeevan Singh, Engineering Manager, Application security at Segment</p> "

For this evening we plan to have a workshop and a talk, and plenty of time for socializing/networking.

Talk: Did you just assume your product is secure?<br/>People tend to assume things. I know I do. It's perfectly normal, it's how our brains evolved to work. Join me in exploring the role of assumptions in our everyday life and how that impacts the security of products we build. Or did I just assume that they do?.. Hmm.</p> <p>Dmitry started as a software engineer building a promising AAA title at an unknown game studio, and continued to be a firmware QA automation engineer and then a firmware developer. Despite that, he spent a lot of free time doing reverse engineering. All that equipped him well with knowledge and skills to start his infosec career almost 10 years ago. Now a senior consultant with the product security team at F-Secure Consulting, he provides advice on security topics to tier-1 automotive, aerospace, maritime, and industrial customers worldwide.</p> <p>2. ImproHound Workshop: Protect your Domain Admins with tiering<br/>It is not viable for system administrators and defenders in a large Active Directory (AD) environment to ensure all AD objects have only the exact permissions they need. It is too big of a task, why many organizations are vulnerable to AD attacks due to too loose or wrong permissions. At the same time, credential theft may lead to privileges AD users having their password stolen when they login to compromised computers. These vulnerabilities are chainable, why you in many AD environments can escalate your rights to Domain Admin no matter what computer or user you have.</p> <p>Microsoft realised this issue, and recommended organizations to implement the AD tier model: Split the AD into three tiers and focus on preventing attack paths leading from one tier to a more business critical tier. The concept is great, but it turns out to be rather difficult to implement the tiering concept in AD, why most organizations fail it and end up leaving security gaps..</p> <p>After this workshop, you will be able to help those organizations! And probably p0wn them..<br/>The workshop is part talk and part workshop and you will need to bring a computer with VMWare/VirtualBox to try out ImproHound. Experience with Active Directory is an advantage, but not a requirement.</p> <p>Jonas B\u00fclow Knudsen is an Active Directory (AD) security advisor. Jonas has spent the past two years helping organizations implement technical countermeasures and remediate vulnerabilities in and around AD, including implementation of the AD tier model. Working closely together with penetration testers and having a strong interest in offensive security enables Jonas to focus on security measures that matter and not just best practice.</p> "

Those URLs can be found in spam emails and forums, received via messaging apps or manually misspelled in the address bar. Although being a simple idea, typosquatting goes hand-in-hand with (spear)phishing attacks that evolved and became more efficient and harder to detect. We will analyze some tools for discovering typo squatted websites and potential malicious domains that can target our organisation or product.</p> <p># Bio<br/>Matej works as a Frontend Developer in Barrage. Besides the passion for frontend, he is interested in AppSec, often can be found poking around TryHackMe or in his room making lazy bash scripts that sometimes save 15 seconds of his life.</p> <p>------------------<br/>Miroslav \u0160tampar: ECSC (European Cyber Security Challenge)</p> <p># Summary<br/>As a member of the organization, the speaker would like to talk about the European Cyber Security Challenge, an annual event for young cyber security talents across Europe, powered by the EU Agency for Cybersecurity. This year is taking place in Prague, Czech Republic, from 28 September to 1st October, therefore first-hand impressions will be presented, gathered at the venue. Joint national goal should be the gathering, training and sending of the young Croatian cyber security team to a competition in the not so distant future.</p> <p># Bio<br/>Miroslav Stampar is an information security expert who lives and works in Zagreb. His scientific and professional interests include research and development of systems from the vast domain of information security. He has given talks at numerous domestic and international expert conventions on information security and programming. He is author of several world-renowned free and open source applications (sqlmap, Maltrail, etc.) In free time, an active CTF player, member of an international top-tier team Super Guesser.</p> "

Dengan semakin kompleks dan terhubungnya infrastruktur digital kita, kesulitan mencapai keamanan aplikasi meningkat secara eksponensial.

Penetration test simulates the attack performed internally or externally by the attackers which have the intention to find security weaknesses or vulnerabilities and validate the potential impacts and risks should those vulnerabilities being exploited.</p> <p>Security issues found through penetration test are presented to the system\u2019s owner, data owner or risk owner. An effective penetration test will support this information with an accurate assessment of the potential impacts to the organization and range of technical and procedural safeguards should be planned and executed to mitigate risks.</p> <p>Many penetration testers are in fact very good in technical since they have skills needed to perform all of the tests, but they are lack of report writing methodology and approach which create a very big gap in penetration testing cycle. A penetration test is useless without something tangible to give to a client or senior management. Report writing is a crucial part of any service providers (eq. IT service/advisory). A report should detail the outcome of the test and, if you are making recommendations, document the recommendations to secure any high-risk systems.</p> <p>The target audience of a penetration testing report will vary, the technical report will be read by IT or any responsible information security people while executive summary will definitely be read by the senior management.<br/>Writing an effective penetration testing report is an art that needs to be learned and to make sure that the report will deliver the right information to the targeted audience.<br/>After reading the book, you will be able to: understand on how to create a good and effective penetration testing report; understand the mechanism to provide effective deliverables; apply risk management knowledge &amp; skills and blend them in your deliverables.<br/>---<br/>Short bio :</p> <p>Semi Yulianto<br/>BSc.

Static activities have context and depth, but lack visibility on the true behavior of the software. On the other hand, runtime activities have no direct access to the internals of the application because they follow an external approach.</p> <p>DevOps teams are demanding a more complete picture of the security of the applications, combining static and dynamic activities. In this practical talk, I want to propose a new approach based on runtime observability, that provides not only vulnerabilities and attacks, but also app deployment intelligence, sensitive data visibility, and API discovery capabilities.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Daniel Blazquez leads the technical marketing and developer advocacy practice at Hdiv Security, a VC-funded application security company focused on application security automation.

The fact that new data breaches, security vulnerabilities, ransomware and physical impacts of cyber-attacks are published daily in the news underlines the fact even more.</p> <p>This talk explains why it is crucial to have security skills in every IT engineering team and why you cannot solely rely on a centralized security department - especially not in the agile world. Next to personal skills, this talk focuses on security best practices in software development. The speaker will highlight topics such as automated security testing methods and give recommendations on invaluable manual periodic security assessments.</p> <p>This presentation is based on the speaker's personal experience and includes many learning's and tips from throughout his career. For example, how-to decide where it is absolutely necessary to invest 100% security effort and where the 80/20 principle is more than enough. Or also, why it is crucial to have a security baseline established, before thinking about a Bug-Bounty program.</p> <p>About Manuel Cianci<br/>Manuel has been a security enthusiast forever. Manuel started his technical security journey when he was 16 years old. His professional security career started some years later as a Security Software Engineer. In order to learn as many technical basics as possible, Manuel worked within different Security Software Engineering positions for more than eight years. Afterwards, he moved to a role as Security Engineer and Security Consultant.</p> <p>For the last three years, Manuel was managing and leading the Security Delivery team of Swisscom. Manuel and his team were responsible for security engineering, consulting, and coaching services for the entire company. During his time at Swisscom, Manuel has been working on many subject areas in the security field. Introducing DevSecOps at Swisscom was one of his main achievements.</p> <p>Just recently, Manuel decided to join cy//ective (cyllective AG) as Managing Partner. cy//ective is a Swiss IT security company, specialized in holistic security services.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Software is incredibly hard to secure because it's a black box. We've spent decades struggling to verify properties of software from the outside by analyzing the source code, scanning, fuzzing, pentesting, etc... The goal of \"security observability\" is to expose exactly what's going on inside the box while it's running. Analyzing a running application has speed, accuracy, coverage, and scalability advantages that change the way Dev, Sec, and Ops communicate and work together. In this talk, you'll learn how to use the free and open source Java Observability Toolkit (JOT) project to easily create your own powerful runtime instrumentation without coding. You can use JOT to analyze security defenses, identify complex vulnerabilities, create custom sandboxes, and enforce policy at runtime. Ultimately, security observability enables DevSecOps to work together in harmony, so you can focus on delivering value at high velocity.</p> <p>Bio: Jeff brings more than 20 years of security leadership experience as co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Contrast Security.

        "description": "<p>Whether you're an elite security researcher or just starting out in security, odds are that you're terrible at effectively explaining vulnerabilities. Sorry, that's just a fact.</p> <p>It's hard to find security vulnerabilities, but it's really difficult to establish trust, clearly and concisely explain the risk, and compel action all while being great to work with and not bruising any egos.</p> <p>You have to be a great team player and absolutely resist the urge to blame. Otherwise you'll undermine your entire security program and culture -- which is really the whole point of finding vulnerabilities in the first place.</p> <p>So, in this talk, I'm going to share the approach I developed over 15 years of consulting with the world\u2019s largest companies. With some practice, you should be able to create a fantastic, compelling vulnerability writeup in less than five minutes.</p> <p>Of course, you have to really understand the vulnerability first, but that's not what this paper is about. This is about what you do after you find something awesome.</p> <p>JEFF WILLIAMS<br/>Jeff brings more than 20 years of security leadership experience as co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Contrast Security.
