Our idolization of hackers, penetration testing and \u2018breaking\u2019 has not resulted in secure software for our industry, only egos, stereotypes and unaffordable security models. Modern application security approaches need to address both offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) approaches, as well as continuous learning and advocacy for developers. This means Purple Team. This talk will explore how to combine defence, offence, automation, empathy and continuous learning, all without the requirement of ever wearing a hoodie. The future of security is PURPLE."

As vendors continue to acquire and build new features, feature parity is on the horizon. For now, they're doing things in their own unique, sometimes odd way.\n\nOver the last few years, Raafey has used, analysed and compared various AppSec tooling. Running them against benchmarks and multiple applications.\nIn this talk, he will go through what makes an AST tool good, why there are SO many false positives, and when they actually make sense to use compared to a good old-fashioned pentest.\n\n**Bio:** Raafey has been a security consultant for many years and leads the AppSec team for CyberCX. His primary focus is working with organisations to understand how they build software and what they can do to make sure they\u2019re protected.\n\nHaving recently moved over from NZ, he\u2019s looking forward to getting to know the Brisbane security community."

I\u2019m passionate about software security. The niche I am currently working on is engineering processes, tools, and internal interfaces to help companies secure their development lifecycles, do vulnerability management and increase overall awareness of the product's security risks.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nTitle: **Is it private, is it public? Dependency Confusion**\n\nSpeaker:\nFrancisco Santos\n\nAbstract:\nBy 2021, the number of components in the average application rose 77 % from 298 to more than 500 open-source packages. Those components are hosted on public repositories such as GitHub, NPM, or PyPI, while some organizations choose to operate proprietary packages inside private registries of those repositories. Private or public, the management is done by CLI (like npm). The CLI imports private or public packages via a simple precedence algorithm: If the package resides inside the private registry, import it. If not, import the public component. How can a bad actor play this to his advantage?\nThe \"is it private, is it public? Dependency Confusion\" talk explains what dependency confusion is, and teaches ways of finding dependency confusion vulnerabilities in js files via BurpSuite with an automated tool called jsminer, a real example of a dependency confusion bug I found, and recommendations to mitigate those issues. By the end, breakers and makers should acquire a fresh new perspective on this issue.\n\n[Francisco Santos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-santos-77917a210/) Bio:\nI'm Francisco Santos, 23 years old. I always liked to think out of the box and find weird solutions to problems. I like logic and solving puzzles. I enjoy being a breaker, and I want to add value to that community.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/andr0idp4r4n0id"

There is limited seating available for in-person attendees. Registration required. Please note that this event will be live-streamed on YouTube for the online audience. Recordings will be available on the OWASP London YouTube channel.\n\n**Venue Location**: Monzo, 5 Appold St, London, EC2A 2AG\n**Nearest Tube:** Liverpool Street - 4 min walk\n**Doors Open at 6pm** for registration, pizza, drinks and networking. The talks start at 6:30pm (we start on time).\n\n**TALKS**\n\n**OWASP Introduction, Welcome and News** \\- Sam Stepanyan\\, Sherif Mansour and Andra Lezza\nWelcome and a brief update on OWASP Projects & Events from the OWASP London Chapter Leaders\n\n**Talk 1:** **What I Found When Modelling Threats In The Open (Source), Dan Conn**\nSecure development is hard. Throughout the entire development of an open source project, security needs to be top of mind due to a potential myriad threats. Some open source orgs are starting to ask for security matrices, and expect some threat modelling to have taken place, so that the threats of a system can be evaluated. This however, can be difficult. Considering the different use cases of a project that may be running in different architectures can be quite a struggle, combined with sometimes working with developers that may not be familiar with threat modelling in general. This talk will explore how to make threat modelling easier for open source developers through using open source tools such as OWASP Threat Dragon and Threagile, and where each is better suited than the other.\n\n**Talk 2: An AppSec Point of View On Synthetic Identities, Timur Yunusov**\nIn the era of neobanks with no branches and broadly adopted eKYC standards, the entry barriers for cybercriminals are extremely low. How could FinTech win in this ongoing cat-and-mouse game? How criminals utilise gaps in workflows of the modern payment ecosystem? After looking at mobile applications and the API workflows of dozens of FinTech companies across Europe, the USA and Asia, I will provide real-world examples from both sides of the battle.\n\n**SPEAKERS**\n\n**Dan Conn (@danjconn)**\nDan Conn likes to sit in the point between cyber security and development and over the past 10 years has worked as a developer in small startups, large corporates and many in between, catering for clients both public and private sector from SME size to enterprise. He has also had a strong interest in cybersecurity for just as long culminating in a postgraduate certificate in Advanced Security and Digital Forensics. Dan is now a Developer Advocate for Sonatype. When not coding, hacking, or talking about these things\u2026 you can find Dan running, skateboarding, DJ-ing or making music!\n\n**Timur Yunusov (@a66ot)**\nTimur Yunusov, Payment security researcher, an application security expert with a focus on FinTech, and one of the Payment Village organisers. Some of Timur's research in the field of application security includes \"Bruteforce of PHPSESSID\" and \"XML Out-Of-Band\" shown at the Black Hat EU back in 2013 . Timur has previously spoken at conferences such as Black Hat EU, BlackHat USA, HackInTheBox, Nullcon, NoSuchCon, CanSecWest, Hack In Paris, ZeroNights, Positive Hack Days and at OWASP meetups.\n\n**TICKETS**\nThis event is free to attend for both members and non-members of OWASP and is open to anyone interested in web application and cyber security.

API security poses unique challenges to builders and defenders, and many of your existing detection and protection measures may prove to be ineffective.\n\nJoin Colin as he draws on his experience from curating the industry's biggest API security resource (APISecurity.io) in exploring the following:\nCrash course on the OWASP API Security Top 10 (and how it differs from the OWASP Top 10)\nA whistle-stop tour of some of the biggest API breaches over the past 18 months, taking a look at what went wrong, the impact, and most importantly, how to prevent such attacks.\nFinally, he will present the top techniques for protecting your APIs from attack, starting with secure development practices through to API protection and threat detection.\n\nThe content will be technical, with demos and code samples, and based on real-world breaches. By the end of the session, you will have an understanding of the API Security Top 10, and have a working knowledge of how to protect your APIs, either at a code level or using runtime protections.\n*Bio:*\nColin has a long and varied career in producing secure, rugged, and trustable software and hardware products covering a range of industries from military, consumer, medical, automotive to financial services. In the last decade, he has become a sought-after evangelist and consultant in building AppSec programs, and the latest developments in DevSecOps. His greatest passion is for teaching and inspiring others to produce software we can trust, either delivering webinars, in-person events or speaking to the C-level.\n\nCurrently, he is the Chief Technology Evangelist with 42Crunch, the curator of the APISecurity.io newsletter, and is writing the industry\u2019s first book on defending APIs.\n\n**Managing APIs securely**\n*Abstract:*\nWhen an organization offers an API, the API needs to become a Managed API. This means that lifecycle management, security, and throttling resources become an important aspect of API Management, as well as the ability of developers to find, explore and subscribe to the API to use them.\n\nDuring the presentation, Rob will zoom into these aspects and how an API Manager can help you with security and throttling (including schema validation and advanced scenarios) while at the same time making the API easily available to your target developers (inside or outside the organization).\n\nIn the second part, he will elaborate on the \u201cshiny frontend / dirty backend\u201d. This is an API frontend that accesses legacy systems, databases, but also the integration of a set of APIs etc., thus enabling services that use older technology or proprietary interfaces to have a modern appearance to the outside world, e.g. exposing a legacy insurance policy administration system as an API.\n\nThirdly, we will look at the way you can implement the Mastodon API. Since Elon Musk acquired Twitter l ast year, alternative platforms like Mastodon have become more popular. It might be that this becomes a viable channel to communicate with clients for some organizations.\n*Bio:*\nRob has 30 years of experience in IT in such roles as developer, analyst, project manager, business consultant, and management consultant. He is currently Head of Training Services and Integration Consultant at Yenlo, responsible for the development and the actual training of Yenlo\u2019s clients and consultants.\n\nNext to these responsibilities, Rob is also an avid blogger with almost 200 blogs on innovation on Frankwatching, more than 150 blogs on WSO2 on Yenlo\u2019s website and many other blogs on various other sites. Rob is also a regular contributor to BNR Zaken Doen radio show on the area of technology and innovation.\n\n**Delegates may be asked to provide a valid proof of photo ID (such as a driving licence or passport) to enter the venue.**"

CTF's usually come in two varieties:\n\n* **Jeopardy**: *is a type of cybersecurity competition. In a CTF, participants work to solve challenges that are often based on real-world scenarios, such as finding vulnerabilities in systems or decoding hidden messages. These challenges are usually organized into categories, such as web security, cryptography, or binary exploitation, and participants earn points for each challenge they successfully solve. CTFs are often used as a way for cybersecurity professionals to learn and improve their skills, and they can also be a lot of fun for people who are interested in this field.*\n\n* **Attack & Defense**: *Attack-Defense CTFs are a type of cybersecurity competition where teams are given a set of resources, such as servers or websites, and must defend them from attacks launched by other teams. At the same time, each team must also try to attack and compromise the resources of the other teams. In this type of CTF, points are usually awarded for successfully launching an attack or successfully defending against an attack.*\n\nWe want to be able to live stream the event, so stay tuned into all of OWASP San Juans social media. If you'd like to help promote, sponsor, donate, develop, or collaborate, please checkout our home page where to go!\n\nTo learn more, reach out to a community member, and we hope to see you there at the event!"

Climb the interactive leaderboard as you vie for the top spot!\nThe CMD+CTRL Cyber Range is ideal for anyone interested in learning how web applications are attacked, furthering their cybersecurity acumen, or honing the skills needed to protect the enterprise. From curious bystanders to active practitioners to Risk and Security Executives, there\u2019s something for everyone.\n\n**Hosts:**\n\n**Geoff Vaughan** is an Application & IT Security expert helping companies secure software and devices throughout all stages of development with Security Innovation. He is passionate about ensuring that software is safe to use for both businesses and end-users alike. Geoff is excited to lead this OWASP chapter through a cyber range and give them the chance to become the attacker.\n\n***Who is Security Innovation? ***\nEveryone wants to solve cybersecurity software challenges and go beyond reactive (but necessary) stopgaps. However, most security providers address symptoms and not the root cause. Security Innovation\u2019s approach is different \u2013 by pragmatically transferring our security expertise across all software security stakeholders, from developers to the C-suite, we help teams get smarter about software security so they are prepared for future challenges. We are able to do this because as a SaaS and assessment provider, we face the same threats our clients do. We also understand the challenges of taking a risk-based approach to software development and operations."
