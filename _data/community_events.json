        "description": "OWASP Aarhus og DEIF holder vores n\u00e6ste meetup tirsdag d. 26. september i Aalborg fra 19.00 - 21:30.\n\nVi vil meget gerne, hvis I hj\u00e6lper hinanden ved at arrangere f\u00e6llesk\u00f8rsel. Skriv meget gerne her!\n\nDetaljerne er ikke helt p\u00e5 plads, men Jens Myrup Pedersen kommer og fort\u00e6ller om hans erfaring med Cyberlandsholdet og Robert Nedergaard Nielsen fort\u00e6ller om Haaukins-platformen.\n\nOm Jens:\n\nJens Myrup Pedersen er professor p\u00e5 Aalborg Universitet, hvor han prim\u00e6rt forsker i netv\u00e6rkssikkerhed og tidlig detektion af skadelig aktivitet, og hvor han er ansvarlig for kandidatuddannelsen i Cybersikkerhed. Jens er ogs\u00e5 involveret i en r\u00e6kke projekter der skal \u00f8ge viden om og interesse for cybersikkerhed blandt unge, herunder Cyberskills - og s\u00e5 har han siden 2021 v\u00e6ret landstr\u00e6ner for Cyberlandsholdet.\n\nTitel: Cyberlandsholdet For The Win\n\nKort beskrivelse:\n\nKom med p\u00e5 rejsen bag Det Danske Cyberlandshold, der i 2022 - som det mindste land nogensinde - vandt de Europ\u00e6iske Mesterskaber i t\u00e6t konkurrence med store lande som Tyskland og Frankrig. Hvert \u00e5r dyster hundredevis af unge danskere om en plads p\u00e5 Cyberlandsholdet. En konkurrence, der starter med \u00e5bne online tr\u00e6nings-sessions der er tilg\u00e6ngelige for alle og ingen s\u00e6rlige foruds\u00e6tninger kr\u00e6ver, og som g\u00e5r gennem Kvalifikationsrunde, Regionale Mesterskaber og Nationale Mesterskaber til den eftertragtede Bootcamp med kun 25 pladser, hvoraf 10 ender p\u00e5 landsholdet. Men det er ikke kun en konkurrence: Det er ogs\u00e5 et vigtigt projekt for at \u00f8ge interessen for cybersikkerhed blandt unge, og derfor er det s\u00e5 vigtigt ogs\u00e5 at skabe noget fedt for det store flertal der ikke kommer p\u00e5 Landsholdet. \u201cCyberlandsholdet For The Win\u201d handler om landsholdets sejr, om arbejdet med at \u00f8ge interessen for cybersikkerhed blandt unge, og om hvorfor de to dele h\u00e6nger s\u00e5 t\u00e6t sammen.\n\n\\- Robert Nedergaard Nielsen er videnskabelig assistent p\u00e5 Aalborg Universitet\\, hvor han spiller en hovedrolle i projekter som Cyberskills og De Danske Cybermesterskaber\\. Han har mere end 5 \u00e5rs erfaring med udvikling\\, drift og anvendelse af tr\u00e6ningsplatformen Haaukins\\, der kombinerer CTF\\-formatet med l\u00e6ring og tr\u00e6ning\\.\n\n\\- Robert vil pr\u00e6sentere Haaukins\\-platformen\\, og de valg der ligger bag i forhold til at skabe en platform\\, der er egnet til \u201cbegyndere\u201d indenfor cybersikkerhed \\- herunder de mange IT\\-professionelle\\, der gerne skal opn\u00e5 en grundl\u00e6ggende viden om sikkerhed uden n\u00f8dvendigvis at blive eksperter\\. Deltagerne f\u00e5r ogs\u00e5 mulighed for selv at arbejde med p\u00e5 nogle af opgaverne\\, der indg\u00e5r som eksempler i opl\u00e6gget\\."

In this talk, we delve into the implementation of how we rolled out secret scanning capabilities within LinkedIn and outline the steps taken to establish an effective secret scanning pipeline.\n\nOur talk navigates you through the complete lifecycle of the secret scanning pipeline starting from identifying secrets, verifying them through our custom validation service, managing the security alert lifecycle alongside developers, and ultimately focusing on the prevention of secrets. Join us to gain understanding of the intricacies and lessons learned while building a robust secret scanning pipeline, from inception to execution.\n\n**6:30pm - 7:00pm**\n\n**GitHub Advisory Database Alerts**\n\n*Speaker: John Maroney, Security Analyst III, GitHub*\n\nThe GitHub advisory database powers security alerts delivered through dependabot. The data itself is curated by the GitHub security lab and is made available for free for everyone forever. Come learn about the curation process and see how the sausage is made.\n\n**7:00pm - 7:30pm**\n\n**Stop Thinking \u201cVuln\u201d: Quantifying Risk to Optimize your AppSec Program**\n\n*Speaker: Idan Plotnik, CEO of Apiiro*\n\nNot all vulns are created equal. Whether surfaced via a tool (SAST, SCA, DAST, container, IaC security, etc.) or a human-led process (bug bounty, pen test, etc.), a vulnerability may or may not actually pose a risk to your business. Is it in deployed code? Is that code internet-facing? Is it exploitable? Is it in a high business impact application? More often than not, it\u2019s non-trivial to answer those questions to understand how risky it is and prioritize it amongst the mountain of other tasks on our plate.\n\nMultiply that across dozens of alert feeds, a constantly-changing application attack surface, and different types of application weaknesses (misconfigs, exposed secrets, API weaknesses, etc.)...There has to be a better way.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll explore the many dimensions of risk and the factors you need to determine whether a vulnerability, misconfiguration, exposed secret, etc. is a real risk, vaguely following the industry-standard risk matrix (also used in the OWASP Risk Rating Calculator). We\u2019ll cover the different likelihood and impact indicators you need to quantify risk and how to get that context programmatically, proactively, and automatically to drastically cut down your backlog and prevent critical risks from being deployed\u2014without overburdening your developers.\n\nPlease complete the form linked above by Tuesday, September 19, 2023 6pm PDT to reserve your spot. Space is limited.\n\n**Super important note: Do not join the waitlist as you will not be registered that way!**"

The Meet up will be in partnership with ESO, who have also kindly offered to host the evening and provide pizza, beers, and soft drinks for everyone.\n\n**Date: 28th September 2023**\n\n**Time: 6.00 PM**\n\n**Location: ESO, 42 Fountain St, Belfast BT1 5EF.**\n\n**Zoom Link:** [https://eso.zoom.us/j/95951081970?from=addon](https://eso.zoom.us/j/95951081970?from=addon)\n\nFirst, we will share an example of how identifying and assessing an attack on an application was used to gain insights into attacker behavior, and how invaluable this can prove in informing future actionable steps to prevent exposure. Next, we will present an overview of the key vulnerabilities associated with the use of social media in business and how easy it is to experience a breach when you do not have the correct policies and procedures in place. We will then delve into the world of ethical hacking, exploring the most common \"low-hanging fruit\" issues encountered over the past year. We will focus on prevalent vulnerabilities like HTML injection, Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), and authentication flaws. Finally, we will finish with a technical talk from Ciaran from Rapid 7 who will take you through software supply chain software issues \u2013 malicious attackers, unsuitable licenses, and deprecated code which can all lead to problems in stuff that used to \"just work\". He will talk about how (despite what sales teams might tell you) there\u2019s no single simple solution to this and show you how to manage your risk in an achievable way.\n\n**Agenda:**\n\n6.00 - 6.20 Networking & Food\n\n6.20 - 6.30 Welcome to ESO Finian / Sarah\n\n6:40 - 7:00 Talk 1: \"The Safety Law of An Idiot Next to You\" by Tanya Vacarda\n\n7:00\u2013 7:20 Talk 2: \"From Likes to Leaks: Understanding the Security Risks of Social Media\" by Anne-Marie O'Donnell\n\n7:20 \u2013 7:30 BREAK (10 min)\n\n7:30 \u2013 7:50 Talk 3: \"Hacking For Devs: Bridging the Gap Between Developers and Hackers\" by Jacob Steadman\n\n7:50 \u2013 8:10 Talk 4 \"A Pragmatic Approach to Software Supply Chain Security\" by Ciaran Conliffe\n\n8.10 - 8.30 Networking and Exit\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nAs always, our events are designed to educate.

Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organisations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.\n\n**The Cyber Security and Networking (CSN) Research Group** at Anglia Ruskin University has close working strategic relationships with industry, professional bodies, law enforcement, government agencies and academia in the delivery of operationally focused applied information and application security research. We have strong international links with professional organisations such as OWASP, BCS, ISC2, CIISec & the Cyber East Cluster amongst others. The primary aims of CSNRG are to help the UK and partner nations to tackle cybercrime, be more resilient to cyber attacks and educate its users for a more secure cyberspace and operational business environment.\n\n**Abstract : Adding SAST to CI/CD, Without Losing Any Friends**\n\nEveryone wants to put tests into the release pipeline, but no one wants to wait hours for them to finish. In this learning lab we will discuss multiple options for adding static application security testing (SAST) to your CI/CD, in ways that won\u2019t compromise speed or results, such as learning which results can be safely ignored, writing your own rules, company-specific checks, scanning PRs instead of commits, splitting blocking scans versus deep audit scans, etc. We will also cover ways to continuously find vulnerabilities.\n\n**Provisional Agenda**\n\n16:45 - Webinar waiting lobby opens\n17:00 - Start of Presentation\n17:50 \u2013 Questions & Answers"

I will show some war stories, techniques and the like to highlight just how vulnerable even high security locations are when it comes to physical penetration testing and that if you have no physical security, you have no cyber security\n\nBrian Harris has a long career of phyiscal pen testing (aka blackteaming) behind him. He can truly do some amazing stuff that can make you stop and wonder why we even bother having locks in the first place, so obviously you don't want to miss this!\n\n**Mikkel R\u00f8mer: Infiltrating modern companies using Supply Chain Attacks**\nCase: Visual Studio Code\nWithin this session we will be deep diving into Supply Chain attacks. Supply chain attacks is a growing phenomenon, which allows the adversary to infiltrate widely whilst gaining the trust of legitimate software brands. This session will be technical. We will be designing and implementing techniques throughout the presentation until a final malware is ready for deployment. With a fully custom build malware, targeting the modern text- and code editing application Visual Studio Code, we will investigate its potential in terms of detection within top class endpoint detect and response software such as CrowdStrike Falcon and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. We will compare the results with similar execution done via the notorious adversary framework Cobalt Strike. Brace yourself for a thrilling journey through the shadows of the digital realm, where adversaries roam undetected.\n\nSpeaker bio from Mikkel coming up!\n\n**Adam Blatchley Hansen and William Ben Embarek: How to get 6th place at DEFCON CTF!**\nEvery year the legendary hacker convention DEFCON hosts one of the oldest and most competitive cybersecurity CTF competitions in the world. This year, Kalmarunionen joined forces with teams from around the nordics as NORSECODE, and travelled to the finals in Las Vegas, where they took home a very impressive 6th place overall. In this talk Adam and William will share the story of the teams road to qualifying for, and competing at the DEFCON CTF finals. Introducing the world of \"CTF\" hacking competitions from the perspective of a top competitive team, and giving an inside look at what it takes to compete in international hacking competitions at the very highest level. From organisational strategies to interesting CTF challenges to internal team tooling, they'll go over what it took for Norsecode to outperform many much larger and more experienced teams, as well as some of the more unexpected challenges they encountered along the way!\n**Bio:** Adam is a PhD student studying Cryptography at Aarhus university, as well Head Coach of Cyberlandsholdet and the current captain of Kalmarunionen and Norsecode. William is a Pentester at TDC NET, as well as being a longtime CTF player with Kalmarunionen he also handled onsite infrastructure for Norsecode during DEFCON finals in Vegas.\n\nOn top of this we'll be giving away the content of that big box of swag (B&B expansion decks included) from our friends at Black Hills Infosec a friend of us recently recovered from a rendez-vous with them af BSides Frankfurt and of course pizza and drinks as usual! (which is why you need to sign up so we know how many are coming. If you can't make it after signing up please update your RSVP to reflect that).\n\nThe lineup is not yet finalized but talks will be around 1 hour each. We start at 17.00 with a short introduction of OWASP Copenhagen, have a talk then pizza, drinks and mingling. After that we'll do the rest of the night's talk.\n\nJoin us - it'll be great!"

Ich berichte von den Antworten, die wir auf unsere Benachrichtigungen bekamen - von Geschenken \u00fcber Misstrauen bis hin zu Verschw\u00f6rungstheorien. Und ich berichte \u00fcber die Ergebnisse der Studien: Was hat funktioniert, und was nicht? Am Ende des Vortrags habt ihr hoffentlich eine bessere Idee, was euch bei einer solchen Aktion erwartet - im Guten wie im Schlechten.\n\n**Generelles zum OWASP-Stammtisch**\n===\n\nBei unseren offenen Treffen geht es um Software und deren Sicherheit im Internet und/oder IT-Security allgemein.

This creates a major challenge for developers who want to test their APIs for security or just people who want to get into API hacking, how on earth do you wade through all the general web security to get to the meat of API hacking, what do you even need to know? This talk is going to break down API hacking from a developer point of view, teaching you everything you need to know about API hacking, from the bugs you can find and to the impact you can cause, to how you can easily test your own work or review your peers. So what are you waiting for join me and go hack yourself!\n\n**7:15 - Refreshments (Food & Drinks & Networking**\n**8:00 - Gerald Benischke - Application DoS vulnerabilities**\nThis AppSec-focussed talk demonstrates how denial of service attacks can be carried out without throwing lots and lots of traffic at a system and effectively stop services. This uses a couple of vulnerabilities in the play framework as an example and describes the impact. This approach can be likened to using precision guided missiles rather than the carpet bombing of DDoS attacks.\n\nI will explore the role that convenience for developers in frameworks combined with unexpected payloads and how this can be exploited. I also draw on how the service mesh can amplify this attack such that multiple instances can be killed with a single request. Furthermore, we look at how Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) offer no protection against this type of attack.\n\nLastly, I will look at what can be done to protect applications against this type of attack.\n\n**9:00 - Vacate venue -> to the pub for more socialising**\n\n**LOCATION**\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nBooking.com\n6 Goods Yard Street Manchester M3 3BG\n\n**SPEAKERS**\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n**Dr Katie Paxton-Fear**\nA lecturer in Cyber Security at Manchester Metropolitan University and a cyber security researcher, but she's far more well known for her hobby. In her free time, she's a hacker, specialising in API hacking teaching others through her YouTube videos. A former developer turned hacker, she used to make RESTful APIs and now she breaks them. She found her first API vulnerability in 2019 which affected Uber and since then she has been hacking APIs ever since, creating hours of content to help others follow in her footsteps. With her PhD in cyber security and machine learning, she loves to introduce a data-driven approach to hacking combining new tools with manual testing to ensure an impactful bug report every time.\n\n**Gerald Benischke**\nI tend to describe myself as both an Agile Fundamentalist and an AppSec Snooper. What does this mean? On the one hand my software development experience has led me to think that the principles of the agile manifesto form the basis of good practices. It boils down to lots of common sense, small steps, learning along the way, not writing code that nobody will want or need and taking processes and procedures with a pinch of salt.\n\nAs an AppSec Snooper, I have been working to make security more approachable and more pragmatic. You could even say, more agile. The only way to deal with a deluge of supply chain vulnerabilities, bad practices copied from StackOverflow or hallucinated by an LLM is to bring security together with development (this is where the \u201cshift left\u201d buzzword applies).\n\n**SPONSORS** (Thank you for supporting our community!!)\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nBooking.com - Venue Sponsor\nBooking.com - Food & Drink Sponsor\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nAre you passionate about a security topic?\n\nDo you want to speak at a future event?\n\nSubmit your interest here - https://forms.gle/zcm9bVNhgDixe8Gq5\n\nDoes your company want to sponsor a venue and/or refreshments?\n\nEmail Paul - paul.johnston@owasp.org"

Learn From Others in the DevOps and DevSecOps Communities\nLook to the DevOps community to help close your critical knowledge gaps.\n2. 2\\. Start With Your Container Security\nThe first step to building out the security of your DevOps toolchain starts with your container security.\n3. Institute Continuous Compliance\nDevSecOps is a platform for continuous compliance to protect your software supply chains against vulnerable packages and vulnerable configurations.\n4. Double Down on Automation\nWhile you may have already been experimenting with automation during your DevOps phase, it only becomes more integral once you throw the switch in by going DevSecOps. Go into your DevOps to DevSecOps transformation with an automation strategy that focuses on automating common developer and sysadmin tasks.\n5. Improve Your Monitoring and Analytics\nBuilding out a DevSecOps toolchain takes your monitoring and analytics options to a new level. Consider the fact that you should already collect and publish data from your toolchain and deliver reports to your project managers, developers, QA testers, and stakeholders outside your team. Commonly, DevOps reporting is still a work in progress for organizations. Use the introduction of new security tools into your toolchain as a chance to offer more granular and real-time security reporting into all parts of your DevSecOps toolchain.\n6. Implement Accessibility Assurance\nDepending on your organization\u2019s definition of compliance, the option is there to add accessibility compliance or Section 508 to your DevSecOps toolchain.\n\nThis hands-on training is reserver for 70% professional and 30% students.\n\nMandatory:\n\nGeneral Conditions in order to validate your participation to this event:\n\n1\\.

As you log in, you behold default creds, no MFA, and a small Cisco firewall set to ALLOW ANY:ANY because hey, having a rule means passing compliance checks. In the corner of your eye, you suddenly start to see alerts appear. Mimikatz, Metasploit, some Cobalt Strike Beacons, LSASS dumps, the lot quickly piles on and on in your environment. No amount of caffeinated adrenaline will help as you watch your environment go up in flames.\nEven the most seasoned veterans can be stricken by keyboard fright when facing the unknown state of a compromised system. Maybe your playbooks are woefully inadequate, out of date, or simply don't exist. Perhaps you've assumed that your tooling will feed you information, but the right information may not always be available or easily consumable. It can be daunting when faced with the prospect of manual box-by-box triage.\nIf you've ever been in any of the aforementioned situations and have stared in incredulity at your terminal then this talk is for you.\nWe will examine the compromised environment from the 2023 WRCCDC security competition and discuss the foundation of the competition and the infrastructure from where all the data was pulled.\n\n**Bio:**\n\u201cK\u201d Singh is currently an Incident Response Consultant at CrowdStrike.

Special thanks to venue and food sponsor Visma.\n\nFirst presentation:\n**Test Driven Application Security**\n\nMost penetration tests find vulnerabilities present in the OWASP TOP 10 lists. Many originate from unclear non-functional requirements and a lack of tests with security in mind. This presentation will demonstrate a test-driven approach to application security and show how we can write automated tests to prove that our defenses work as expected. Demos will be in C#, for an API in [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) Core 7.\n\nTarget audience\nAll concerned with building secure applications. The demos are in C#, it is good to have a basic understanding of C# and unit testing, but the concepts and security best practices relevant regardless of programming background and level.\n\nTobias Ahnoff - Application security specialist at Omegapoint\nTobias Ahnoff is an experienced .NET developer and architect with focus on application security. He specializes in implementing authentication flows and authorization for web applications and APIs that manage sensitive data in the bank, finance, and health sectors. He performs security reviews and penetration tests as part of Omegapoint Cybersecurity Gothenburg, a group of experts in application security.\n\nMartin Altenstedt - Application security specialist at Omegapoint\nMartin Altenstedt is a software developer and architect with 25 years of experience in Sweden's IT industry. He specializes in being able to take part in both the development and management of software. He is part of Omegapoint Cybersecurity Gothenburg, a group of experts in application security, and has developed several courses in secure application development and gives presentations on application development and security.\n\nSecond presentation:\n**Post-Quantum Cryptography 101 - aka. The end of the world as we know it**\n\nYou might have heard that the advent of Quantum Computers heralds the end of commonly used cryptography, but what does that mean, and why does it concern you?\nIn this talk, I will help answer some of these questions. You will learn what a Quantum Computer is, why they are such a bad thing for cryptography, and what you should do about it.\n\nTarget audience\nThe talk does not require any prior knowledge, but some points will be lost to non-technical participants.\nDevelopers, Tech Leads and Architects will get the most out of the talk, but the content is adapted to a varied audience so managers of technology businesses would also benefit.\n\nStian Svedenborg\nStian is a security enthusiast with a passion for cryptography. He graduated from NTNU in 2014 specializing in cryptography and spent a number of years as a developer. He has entered the eID space as the Security Architect for BankID."

Not surprisingly, Web APIs contribute more than 80% of the Internet traffic today. Given the importance of APIs, OWASP has recommended top-10 API specific security vulnerabilities (such as Broken Authentication/Authorization and Excessive Data Exposure problems) that organizations must address to strengthen their security posture. Albeit useful, these API specific vulnerabilities do not necessarily translate to the same business risks. For instance, two APIs from an organization with Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) may pose very different business risks to that organization.\n\nIn this session, we'll talk about API Risk Rating System (ARRS) that maps API specific vulnerabilities to business risks such as Legal/Contractual, Operational, Financial, Reputational and Regulatory. Similar in-principle yet different than Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), the main objective of ARRS is to prioritize API specific vulnerabilities based on their business risks. We'll describe the methodology behind the system developed using thousands of APIs that are being tracked at a global scale. We\u2019ll also share some hands-on practical scenarios.\n\nThe work presented was done by Samantha Sanchez, Jun Hee Lee, Alberto Ciconi and Baljeet Malhotra. Samantha, Jun Hee and Alberto are MSc Cybersecurity students at NYIT. Baljeet is an Adjunct Professor at NYIT, UBC, UVic, UNBC, and CEO of TeejLab Inc."
