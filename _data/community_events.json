Writing secure code is even harder. Serious security vulnerabilities often stem from small programming mistakes. As developers, we can safeguard our applications by catching these mistakes in our own code.\nPerforming a source code review is one of the best ways to find security issues in code. But how do you do it? In this workshop, we will first go through the basics of how to review your code for vulnerabilities and some tactics for performing an effective security code review on your application.\nBut the process of manually analyzing code for vulnerabilities can be very time-consuming. In the second part of this talk, we will also talk about how to use the interactive code analysis tool Joern to make code analysis more efficient. How do you effectively trace user input in code? How can you efficiently link bug sources to sensitive sink functions?"

It's a foundational part of building a security culture and uncovers potential security issues before they slip into production.\nProactively protecting data from the app to the API requires modeling potential attacks to mitigate weak points before bad actors find them. A team of 15 security veterans and experts, including Chris Romeo, CEO of Security journey, created the Threat Modeling Manifesto. Chris is a veteran security expert focused on developing a security culture through training and education. During this session, he will discuss why a manifesto, how you can use it as a foundational piece of your threat modeling program, and practical application tips for building an Enterprise-class threat modeling program.\n\nBio:\n\nChris Romeo is CEO and co-founder of Security Journey and is a builder of security culture influencing education. His passion is to bring security culture change to all organizations, large and small, by providing gamified security programs. Chris is a highly rated industry speaker and trainer, featured at RSA Conference, OWASP Global AppSec, and ISC2 Security Congress. Chris was the Chief Security Advocate at Cisco for five years, empowering engineers to shift security left in all products and led Cisco\u2019s security belt program (Cisco Security Ninja). Chris has twenty-three years of security experience, holding positions across the gamut, including application security, security engineering, and incident response.

        "description": "Come join us to hear OWASP LA's monthly presentation by Matt Tesauro, a Distinguished Engineer at Noname Security\n\nTOPIC: Peeling the Onion: Making Sense of the Layers of API Security\n\nABSTRACT: APIs are everywhere. Any business with a mobile app, modern web apps (SPAs), using the cloud, doing a digital transformation, integrating with business partners, running microservices or using kubernetes has APIs. There's a good foundation of AppSec knowledge out there - thanks in part to OWASP but API Security isn't exactly the same as AppSec. Additional complexity is part of the landscape with multiple competing API technologies like REST, gRPC and GraphQL plus stakeholders spread across multiple parts of the business. How to do you make sense of API Security landscape? This talk will cover the three fundamental areas to consider, the various chess pieces and the many ways those pieces can be put on your API chessboard. The goal is for you to leave knowing how to map out your API Security landscape and reach a state of solid API Security.\n\nBIO: Matt Tesauro is a DevSecOps and AppSec guru with specialization in creating security programs, leveraging automation to maximize team velocity and training emerging and senior professionals. When not writing automation code in Go, Matt is pushing for DevSecOps everywhere via his involvement in open-source projects, presentations, trainings and new technology innovation.\n\nAs a versatile engineer, Matt\u2019s background spans software development (primarily web development), Linux system administration, penetration testing and application / cloud security. He thrives on tackling technical problems, but his economics background gives him a unique understanding of business constraints and incentives around security initiatives.\n\nCurrently, as a Distinguished Engineer at Noname Security, Matt is evangelizing Noname\u2019s ground-breaking API security platform and API security in general. Previously, he rolled out AppSec automation at USAA and founded 10Security. Early in his career, Matt served as Director of Community and Operations at the OWASP Foundation, Senior AppSec Engineer at Duo Security, Senior Software Security Engineer at Pearson and Senior Product Security Engineer at Rackspace.\n\nMeeting info will be available on meetup - BE SURE TO RSVP to access the link\n\nATTENTION SPONSORS: YOUR NAME COULD BE HERE\nContact sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

Goel\n20:00 - 20:15 Break\n20:15 - 21:00 Gamification of Threat Modelling by Grant Ongers\n\nA story on scaling threat modeling across 500+ DevOps teams.\n\nThis talk is not about \u201cwhat is threat modelling, and what are the different methodologies?\u201d. This is well known and understood by now. With every organization moving towards DevSecOps, the difficult question is \u201chow to do Threat Modeling at scale?\u201d. I want to take this opportunity to share with you the ABN AMRO story about how we did this!\n\nAbhishek k. Goel is a Security Consultant at ABN Amro and the IT lead for Threat Modelling capability at the bank. He is a senior security engineer responsible for enabling security in DevOps across the bank.\nBefore ABN, he was a Lead Security Consultant with Deloitte USI and enabled security in CICD pipelines for clients across the globe.\n\nGamification of Threat Modelling\n\nThe talk is all about doing security architecture and threat modelling work as part of development planning.\nThe presentation starts by introducing OWASP Cornucopia and the simplified OWASP \u201cTop 5\u201d for developers and then moves into looking at how one can practically include a form of threat modelling (using Cornucopia) into one\u2019s agile development practises in an effective manner.\nThere is a brief discussion on gamification, covering the usual FAQs on that and then it moves onto implementation at scale and some of the experiences we\u2019ve had there.\n\nCo-founder of Secure Delivery and current OWASP Global Foundation board member, Grant Ongers (@rewtd), is a firm believer in security enabling delivery not blocking it. The philosophy and purpose of Secure Delivery is in the name: optimal delivery and security in one nimble and adaptive offering.\nGrant\u2019s experience spans Dev - building platforms for Telcos, MSPs and Financial institutions for more than 10 years. 20+ years in Ops, running operational teams in global NOCs to managing mainframe and database systems. He also has over 30 years pushing the limits of (Info)Sec - mostly white-hat. He\u2019s worked on both sides of the TPSA table, for and with regulated orgs ensuring compliance and matching \u201cappetite for\u201d with \u201cacceptance of\u201d risk.\nGrant\u2019s community involvement is global: Staff at BSides (London, Las Vegas, and Cape Town), Goon at DEF CON (USA) for over a decade and DC2721 co-founder, staff at BlackHat (USA and EU).\nAlongside his role as CTO within Secure Delivery, Grant provides C-suite advice and guidance on security to FTSE100 enterprises and strategic risk analysis within M&A diligence teams.\n\nThis is an online meeting and will be streamed on YouTube."

        "description": "Getting started in Ethical Hacking can seem daunting. There is so much information out there, so many websites, tools, YouTube videos, courses, etc etc. Where do you start? Do you have to do a course or be certified? Do I need to set up my own testing lab, and if so, what operating system and tools do I use? Is there a way to learn for free? So many questions. It can feel so overwhelming at times, enough to put you off.\n\nThe aim of this event is to offer an open discussion where we can all share tips, tricks, resources and suggestions around how to go about getting started in Ethical Hacking. Everything from how to make learning fun, recommended resources such as websites, podcasts, gamification sites (CTFs), tools, bug bounty platforms and tips and tricks on how to learn and remain focused.\n\nThis event will be open to members of OWASP Suffolk and other OWASP groups. This event will not be recorded.\n\nAgenda:\n\n* Welcome back & overview of what we have in store for 2022\n* OWASP updates\n* Open discussion on how to get started in Ethical Hacking"

        "description": "Happy New 2022! We are resuming our OWASP Belfast events series and the first one is about API security!\n\nWeb applications are prone to various cybersecurity risks. Did you know that 96% of these web applications contain some Open Source? Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs?\nYou may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues. Gartner has actually predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance, and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks.\nThis session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks. We\u2019ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use for managing their API risks.
