Silva, OWASP API Security Project co-Leader\n\nIn today's app-crazy universe, APIs are the secret sauce behind the magic. Think of them as the superheroes of tech, from banking to retail, transport to smart cities, they're the unsung heroes revealing the secrets of business logic and access to the treasure trove of sensitive data. But hold on to your cyberhats because where there's treasure, there are pirates!\n\nAPIs have become the gold mine for attackers. They're the common thread weaving through those notorious data breaches we've all heard about. Now, how do you turn the tables on these cyber scoundrels? Well, the answer is simple: learn their tricks, and you'll become the ultimate API security hero! We're here to take you on a thrilling, rollercoaster ride into the heart of API security: a hands-on deep dive into the OWASP API Security Top 10!\n\n**About the Speaker**\nPaulo is the Principal Security Researcher and Pentester at Char49. Since his first OWASP local event back in 2010, he has been an active community member contributing to several OWASP projects. He has co-authored the OWASP API Security Top 10 and co-leads the OWASP API Security Project."

As we reflect on the past year's achievements, we're excited to kick off a series of meetups that will lead us into the highly anticipated OWASP Global AppSec Lisbon Event. This first meetup of the series will set the stage for an incredible journey towards building more secure applications and connecting with fellow appsec enthusiasts.\n\nThe meetup takes place on November 15th, 2023, at 18:00, at the OLX office, and is **sponsored by OLX and AP2SI**.\n\nThe schedule is the following:\n18:00 - **The Cake** by the OWASP Lisboa chapter leadership team\n18:15 - **Seeing What\u2019s Wrong Just Right** by Jasvir Nagra\n19:10 - **Why everyone in your cyber security team needs to be an AI expert** by Dinis Cruz\n20:00 - **Drinks & Dinner** by OLX\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n**Talks**:\n\nTitle: **Seeing What\u2019s Wrong Just Right**\n\nSpeaker: **Jasvir Nagra**\n\nAbstract:\nWriting web applications is hard. Debugging them is harder. Security bugs are even harder because not only does an application have to work, it has to stop working when the input is malicious. One approach web developers have taken to managing the complexity of writing large web programs is to make it harder to write incorrect programs. Static type checkers, linters, tests and testing frameworks have all made it easier to write correct code. Nevertheless, incorrect and vulnerable programs still exist. In fact, the very success of these tools in avoiding common errors has meant developers spend increasing amounts of time debugging only subtle bugs. In distributed systems, the challenge is even harder because debugging tools give you glimpses into the program state\u2014some on the server, some on the client\u2014without giving you a coherent view of the entire system. Not only are web programs inherently distributed between the server and the client, any one web page in the browser is itself made up of different iframes, events and event handlers, and sometimes service workers all communicating asynchronously. In this talk, I will share a few painful distributed web app debugging anecdotes and an alternate approach to get a holistic view of a program to track down elusive bugs. This approach uses virtualization to create complete traces of just those aspects of the program we suspect are buggy without having to model all program state. Virtualization allows us to momentarily ignore incidental bugs discovered while hunting the core one without it getting in the way, and visualization of the collected traces to build up causal diagrams to inform our intuition when our mental models deviate from reality. I will demonstrate how to recognize and tackle debugging problems with this approach and cover pitfalls you may run into with virtualization.\n\nBio:\nJasvir Nagra is widely recognized as a thought leader in software protection. He is co-author of Surreptitious Software, the definitive textbook on software protection, and an early researcher in obfuscation, software watermarking, and fingerprinting. With more than 12 years of experience, his professional path includes companies such as Instart, Dropbox and Google - where he led the Caja project. As an advisor to Jscrambler, he is helping cybersecurity startups address key technological challenges.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nTitle: **Why everyone in your cyber security team needs to be an AI expert**\n\nSpeaker: **Dinis Cruz**\n\nAbstract:\nSimilar to how electricity revolutionised our lives and is now ubiquitous, Gen AI is poised to become an integral part of everything Cyber Security teams do everyday. Therefore, there is an increasing need to deepen our understanding and expertise in this transformative technology. It's time to embrace the opportunities AI presents and equip ourselves with the knowledge to thrive in this rapidly evolving landscape.\n\nBio:\nDinis Cruz is the Chief Scientist of Glasswall and the CISO of Holland & Barrett, who brings a unique blend of Security and Engineering expertise with 20+ years experience in Cyber Security and Software Development. Dinis is focused on creating Gen AI powered teams and environments where engineering and security are enablers and accelerators for the business, with a big focus on the productisation and commercialisation of advanced technologies."

Learn From Others in the DevOps and DevSecOps Communities\nLook to the DevOps community to help close your critical knowledge gaps.\n2. 2\\. Start With Your Container Security\nThe first step to building out the security of your DevOps toolchain starts with your container security.\n3. Institute Continuous Compliance\nDevSecOps is a platform for continuous compliance to protect your software supply chains against vulnerable packages and vulnerable configurations.\n4. Double Down on Automation\nWhile you may have already been experimenting with automation during your DevOps phase, it only becomes more integral once you throw the switch in by going DevSecOps. Go into your DevOps to DevSecOps transformation with an automation strategy that focuses on automating common developer and sysadmin tasks.\n5. Improve Your Monitoring and Analytics\nBuilding out a DevSecOps toolchain takes your monitoring and analytics options to a new level. Consider the fact that you should already collect and publish data from your toolchain and deliver reports to your project managers, developers, QA testers, and stakeholders outside your team. Commonly, DevOps reporting is still a work in progress for organizations. Use the introduction of new security tools into your toolchain as a chance to offer more granular and real-time security reporting into all parts of your DevSecOps toolchain.\n6. Implement Accessibility Assurance\nDepending on your organization\u2019s definition of compliance, the option is there to add accessibility compliance or Section 508 to your DevSecOps toolchain.\n\nThis hands-on training is reserver for 70% professional and 30% students.\n\nMandatory:\n\nGeneral Conditions in order to validate your participation to this event:\n\n1\\. Student must send University/Student ID\\, otherwise registration will be rejected\\.\n\n2.Professional must register company emails, otherwise registration will be rejected.\n\nRegistration only via EventBrite. We don't accept answer via meetup.\n\nPlease indicate your firstname, lastname, company name, a valid business email or school email (email like gmai, free, hotmail, outlook, etc are not accepted and registration will be cancelled).\n\nPlease register here:\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/billets-devsecops-toolchain-transformation-374188276207"
