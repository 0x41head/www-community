Besides his work life, he runs a YouTube channel where he details challenges, CVEs, and all kinds of cybersecurity related topics in videos.

In this presentation, I would like to introduce all of you into what AI could mean for you in the cybersecurity field. We're going on a journey on what is possible and what will be possible when combining AI with cybersecurity.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;Joona Hoikkala - Red Team Manager @Visma</p> <p>Working as red team manager at Visma, Joona is a hacker that has experience from multiple vantage points and aspects of information security, software development and brewing. He's an open so(u)rcerer and has built or contributed to a wide variety of security tools, both offensive and defensive. This talk is discussing both positive and negative phenomenom around a web fuzzing tool he built and maintains: ffuf, or: \"fuzz faster u fool\".</p> <p>~*FFUF - Fuzz Faster, U're ***ed ... The good, the bad and the ugly of web fuzzing~<br/>Abstract: Web fuzzing is a powerful method for automating the boring tasks in both black box, and gray box testing of web applications. There's only so much one can do when approaching this kind of target manually but with proper tooling the server resources are the only limit. Wait? Server resources being the limit?</p> <p>Penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, security researchers and criminals are using the same techniques for different purposes. What happens when you are able to send tens of thousands of requests from your laptop, over the internet to a target. What if you scale it up horizontally, doing the same thing from hundreds of sources?
