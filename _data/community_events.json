        "description": "OWASP Aarhus og DEIF holder vores n\u00e6ste meetup tirsdag d. 26. september i Aalborg fra 19.00 - 21:30.\n\nVi vil meget gerne, hvis I hj\u00e6lper hinanden ved at arrangere f\u00e6llesk\u00f8rsel. Skriv meget gerne her!\n\nDetaljerne er ikke helt p\u00e5 plads, men Jens Myrup Pedersen kommer og fort\u00e6ller om hans erfaring med Cyberlandsholdet og Robert Nedergaard Nielsen fort\u00e6ller om Haaukins-platformen.\n\nOm Jens:\n\nJens Myrup Pedersen er professor p\u00e5 Aalborg Universitet, hvor han prim\u00e6rt forsker i netv\u00e6rkssikkerhed og tidlig detektion af skadelig aktivitet, og hvor han er ansvarlig for kandidatuddannelsen i Cybersikkerhed. Jens er ogs\u00e5 involveret i en r\u00e6kke projekter der skal \u00f8ge viden om og interesse for cybersikkerhed blandt unge, herunder Cyberskills - og s\u00e5 har han siden 2021 v\u00e6ret landstr\u00e6ner for Cyberlandsholdet.\n\nTitel: Cyberlandsholdet For The Win\n\nKort beskrivelse:\n\nKom med p\u00e5 rejsen bag Det Danske Cyberlandshold, der i 2022 - som det mindste land nogensinde - vandt de Europ\u00e6iske Mesterskaber i t\u00e6t konkurrence med store lande som Tyskland og Frankrig. Hvert \u00e5r dyster hundredevis af unge danskere om en plads p\u00e5 Cyberlandsholdet. En konkurrence, der starter med \u00e5bne online tr\u00e6nings-sessions der er tilg\u00e6ngelige for alle og ingen s\u00e6rlige foruds\u00e6tninger kr\u00e6ver, og som g\u00e5r gennem Kvalifikationsrunde, Regionale Mesterskaber og Nationale Mesterskaber til den eftertragtede Bootcamp med kun 25 pladser, hvoraf 10 ender p\u00e5 landsholdet. Men det er ikke kun en konkurrence: Det er ogs\u00e5 et vigtigt projekt for at \u00f8ge interessen for cybersikkerhed blandt unge, og derfor er det s\u00e5 vigtigt ogs\u00e5 at skabe noget fedt for det store flertal der ikke kommer p\u00e5 Landsholdet. \u201cCyberlandsholdet For The Win\u201d handler om landsholdets sejr, om arbejdet med at \u00f8ge interessen for cybersikkerhed blandt unge, og om hvorfor de to dele h\u00e6nger s\u00e5 t\u00e6t sammen.\n\n\\- Robert Nedergaard Nielsen er videnskabelig assistent p\u00e5 Aalborg Universitet\\, hvor han spiller en hovedrolle i projekter som Cyberskills og De Danske Cybermesterskaber\\. Han har mere end 5 \u00e5rs erfaring med udvikling\\, drift og anvendelse af tr\u00e6ningsplatformen Haaukins\\, der kombinerer CTF\\-formatet med l\u00e6ring og tr\u00e6ning\\.\n\n\\- Robert vil pr\u00e6sentere Haaukins\\-platformen\\, og de valg der ligger bag i forhold til at skabe en platform\\, der er egnet til \u201cbegyndere\u201d indenfor cybersikkerhed \\- herunder de mange IT\\-professionelle\\, der gerne skal opn\u00e5 en grundl\u00e6ggende viden om sikkerhed uden n\u00f8dvendigvis at blive eksperter\\. Deltagerne f\u00e5r ogs\u00e5 mulighed for selv at arbejde med p\u00e5 nogle af opgaverne\\, der indg\u00e5r som eksempler i opl\u00e6gget\\."

Following registration confirmation, we will reach out to you for your size.*\n\n**Date** \\| Wednesday\\, September 20\\, 2023\n\n**Time** \\| 5:00 p\\.m\\. \\- 8:00 p\\.m\\.\n\n**Guest Check-in**\n\nGitHub\n\n275 Brannan Street\n\nSan Francisco, CA 94107\n\n**Agenda**\n\n* 5:00 - Check in, grab some food/drinks and network\n\n* 5:45 - Introductions\n\n* 6:00 - 6:20 - Building a Robust Secret Scanning Pipeline (LinkedIn)\n\n* 6:30 - 7:00 - GitHub Advisory Database Alerts (GitHub)\n\n* 7:00- 7:30 - Stop Thinking \"Vuln\": Quantifying Risk to Optimize your AppSec Program (Apiiro)\n\n* 7:30 - Networking\n\n* 8:00 - Conclusion\n\n## About the Sessions\n\n**6:00pm - 6:20pm**\n\n**Building a Robust Secret Scanning Pipeline**\n\n*Speakers:*\n\n*Aashna Sethi, Security Engineer, LinkedIn*\n\n*Francis Alexander, Staff Security Engineer, LinkedIn*\n\n*Emmanuel Law, Senior Staff Security Engineer, LinkedIn*\n\nLeakage of Secrets is one of the most common problems organizations face and often acts as the starting vector for the majority of the attacks. In this talk, we delve into the implementation of how we rolled out secret scanning capabilities within LinkedIn and outline the steps taken to establish an effective secret scanning pipeline.\n\nOur talk navigates you through the complete lifecycle of the secret scanning pipeline starting from identifying secrets, verifying them through our custom validation service, managing the security alert lifecycle alongside developers, and ultimately focusing on the prevention of secrets. Join us to gain understanding of the intricacies and lessons learned while building a robust secret scanning pipeline, from inception to execution.\n\n**6:30pm - 7:00pm**\n\n**GitHub Advisory Database Alerts**\n\n*Speaker: John Maroney, Security Analyst III, GitHub*\n\nThe GitHub advisory database powers security alerts delivered through dependabot. The data itself is curated by the GitHub security lab and is made available for free for everyone forever. Come learn about the curation process and see how the sausage is made.\n\n**7:00pm - 7:30pm**\n\n**Stop Thinking \u201cVuln\u201d: Quantifying Risk to Optimize your AppSec Program**\n\n*Speaker: Idan Plotnik, CEO of Apiiro*\n\nNot all vulns are created equal. Whether surfaced via a tool (SAST, SCA, DAST, container, IaC security, etc.) or a human-led process (bug bounty, pen test, etc.), a vulnerability may or may not actually pose a risk to your business. Is it in deployed code? Is that code internet-facing? Is it exploitable? Is it in a high business impact application? More often than not, it\u2019s non-trivial to answer those questions to understand how risky it is and prioritize it amongst the mountain of other tasks on our plate.\n\nMultiply that across dozens of alert feeds, a constantly-changing application attack surface, and different types of application weaknesses (misconfigs, exposed secrets, API weaknesses, etc.)...There has to be a better way.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll explore the many dimensions of risk and the factors you need to determine whether a vulnerability, misconfiguration, exposed secret, etc. is a real risk, vaguely following the industry-standard risk matrix (also used in the OWASP Risk Rating Calculator). We\u2019ll cover the different likelihood and impact indicators you need to quantify risk and how to get that context programmatically, proactively, and automatically to drastically cut down your backlog and prevent critical risks from being deployed\u2014without overburdening your developers.\n\nPlease complete the form linked above by Tuesday, September 19, 2023 6pm PDT to reserve your spot. Space is limited.\n\n**Super important note: Do not join the waitlist as you will not be registered that way!**"

We will delve into the process of creating reliable and accurate security intelligence feeds using a combination of automated tools and manual analysis to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs). Additionally, we will explore the creation of industry-grade security intelligence feeds by leveraging multiple known and unknown sources tailored to an organization\u2019s specific needs. Our discussion will also include how proactive threat hunting can reveal the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers, which can inform the development of robust security strategies.\n\n 19:15 - Capture the Flag - Secure Coding\n\nThe CTF will take place as soon as the session is finished, make sure to register at the event entrance as participation spots are limited. Bring you own device and join the CTF locally with it. We will have sitting area ready for the competition.\n\nThis time the challenges will be solely around secure coding. You will accumulate points as you advance through challenges.

Specifically, it focuses on a deep dive into key security controls like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and explores associated risks with service accounts. Additionally, the talk presents a novel approach highlighting how an attacker could exploit Node authorization certificate keys to achieve long-term persistence within AKS environments and their underlying containers. Furthermore, the presentation describes and demonstrates an attack against a vulnerable Grafana enterprise application by leveraging directory traversal techniques to steal privileged tokens. These tokens serve as a stepping stone for further pivoting into the container environment. The talk also addresses the inherent shortcomings of default Azure Kubernetes deployments, including vulnerabilities related to secrets management, pod security admission, and underlying networks. By shedding light on these deficiencies, attendees gain a comprehensive understanding of the security challenges and potential avenues for improvement in AKS environments.\n\nBio:\n\nSadi Zane is a Principal Cyber Security Consultant specialising in offensive security, Red Team/Purple Team exercises, and extensive experience in Orchestration technologies e.g., Cloud on premise Kubernetes container security systems.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadi-zane-bb6430206/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadi-zane-bb6430206/)"

Learn From Others in the DevOps and DevSecOps Communities\n\nLook to the DevOps community to help close your critical knowledge gaps.\n\n2. 2\\. Start With Your Container Security\n\nThe first step to building out the security of your DevOps toolchain starts with your container security.\n\n3. Institute Continuous Compliance\n\nDevSecOps is a platform for continuous compliance to protect your software supply chains against vulnerable packages and vulnerable configurations.\n\n4. Double Down on Automation\n\nWhile you may have already been experimenting with automation during your DevOps phase, it only becomes more integral once you throw the switch in by going DevSecOps. Go into your DevOps to DevSecOps transformation with an automation strategy that focuses on automating common developer and sysadmin tasks.\n\n5. Improve Your Monitoring and Analytics\n\nBuilding out a DevSecOps toolchain takes your monitoring and analytics options to a new level. Consider the fact that you should already collect and publish data from your toolchain and deliver reports to your project managers, developers, QA testers, and stakeholders outside your team. Commonly, DevOps reporting is still a work in progress for organizations. Use the introduction of new security tools into your toolchain as a chance to offer more granular and real-time security reporting into all parts of your DevSecOps toolchain.\n\n6. Implement Accessibility Assurance\n\nDepending on your organization\u2019s definition of compliance, the option is there to add accessibility compliance or Section 508 to your DevSecOps toolchain.\n\nThis hands-on training is reserver for 70% professional and 30% students.\n\nMandatory:\n\nGeneral Conditions in order to validate your participation to this event:\n\n1\\. Student must send University/Student ID\\, otherwise registration will be rejected\\.\n\n2.Professional must register company emails, otherwise registration will be rejected.\n\nRegistration only via EventBrite. We don't accept answer via meetup.\n\nPlease indicate your firstname, lastname, company name, a valid business email or school email (email like gmai, free, hotmail, outlook, etc are not accepted and registration will be cancelled).\n\nPlease register here:\n\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/billets-devsecops-toolchain-transformation-374188276207"

Special thanks to venue and food sponsor Visma.\n\nFirst presentation:\n\n**Test Driven Application Security**\n\nMost penetration tests find vulnerabilities present in the OWASP TOP 10 lists. Many originate from unclear non-functional requirements and a lack of tests with security in mind. This presentation will demonstrate a test-driven approach to application security and show how we can write automated tests to prove that our defenses work as expected. Demos will be in C#, for an API in [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) Core 7.\n\nTarget audience\n\nAll concerned with building secure applications. The demos are in C#, it is good to have a basic understanding of C# and unit testing, but the concepts and security best practices relevant regardless of programming background and level.\n\nTobias Ahnoff - Application security specialist at Omegapoint\n\nTobias Ahnoff is an experienced .NET developer and architect with focus on application security. He specializes in implementing authentication flows and authorization for web applications and APIs that manage sensitive data in the bank, finance, and health sectors. He performs security reviews and penetration tests as part of Omegapoint Cybersecurity Gothenburg, a group of experts in application security.\n\nMartin Altenstedt - Application security specialist at Omegapoint\n\nMartin Altenstedt is a software developer and architect with 25 years of experience in Sweden's IT industry. He specializes in being able to take part in both the development and management of software. He is part of Omegapoint Cybersecurity Gothenburg, a group of experts in application security, and has developed several courses in secure application development and gives presentations on application development and security.\n\nSecond presentation:\n\n**Post-Quantum Cryptography 101 - aka. The end of the world as we know it**\n\nYou might have heard that the advent of Quantum Computers heralds the end of commonly used cryptography, but what does that mean, and why does it concern you?\n\nIn this talk, I will help answer some of these questions. You will learn what a Quantum Computer is, why they are such a bad thing for cryptography, and what you should do about it.\n\nTarget audience\n\nThe talk does not require any prior knowledge, but some points will be lost to non-technical participants.\n\nDevelopers, Tech Leads and Architects will get the most out of the talk, but the content is adapted to a varied audience so managers of technology businesses would also benefit.\n\nStian Svedenborg\n\nStian is a security enthusiast with a passion for cryptography. He graduated from NTNU in 2014 specializing in cryptography and spent a number of years as a developer. He has entered the eID space as the Security Architect for BankID."

This presentation delves into the significance of the leaked files, shedding light on the role of private contractors in cyber warfare and the implications for global cybersecurity. It explores the capabilities of Amezit, Skan, and Krystal2V, three prominent tools mentioned in the leaked documents, providing insights into their functionality and potential impact. By examining the authenticity of the files, assessing their usage, and analyzing the broader implications, this research aims to deepen our understanding of Russia's cyber capabilities and the challenges they pose for international security. The findings underscore the need for stronger regulations, international cooperation, and enhanced defence strategies to counter the evolving threats in the cyber domain.\n\n**Speaker Bio:**\n\nBy day, Julian works as a penetration tester hunting vulnerabilities to exploit. By night, Julian is a researcher and journalist focused on Russian cyberspace.
