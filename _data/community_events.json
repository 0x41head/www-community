Logs are so much more than just for debugging, mapping system performance or error finding. They tell the tales of what has occurred in a system at any given time. When things never go right I believe one should push left. This means if we do not have logs in Application Development we can use for when a breach occurs we should build them. These philosophies focusses on five things that will help your application logs become more than just there for debugging and performance, they build in forensic readiness for future breaches, it also deals with sensitive data disclosure.</p> <p>Veronica started her forensic career in 2008. She is the Director of Incident Response within DFIRLABS. Veronica is also an Assistant Professor at Noroff University. Veronica holds a Master in Science at Rhodes University in Information Security with specialisation in the forensic analysis of malware. She prides herself in keeping patients safe as this is something which is near to her heart. She is also a cyborg sporting an embedded medical device herself. She also is a DEF CON Goon and she is the founder of DC2751.<br/>Her particular research interests include research into security vulnerabilities in medical devices forming part of the Internet of Things, and how these could be exploited by malicious attackers, as well as what types of forensic artefacts could be identified from any attacks. She is extremely passionate about protecting people whose lives depend on these medical devices, and her passion saw her becoming a researcher within an MDM. She is also developing a digital forensics and incident response approach dealing specifically with implanted medical devices and medical devices installed within a healthcare setting. At her core Veronica is a forensicator and hacker and in love with every bit, byte and nibble of knowledge she has obtained.

It's like a code-aware grep, enabling you to easily search for complicated code patterns without writing painful abstract syntax tree (AST) visitors or using heavyweight, expensive, proprietary traditional SAST tools.</p> <p>Key Semgrep features:<br/>- Fast - scans code in minutes, not hours or days.<br/>- Does not require the source code you\u2019re scanning to be buildable.<br/>- Comes out of the box with over 1,000 open source rules covering the OWASP Top 10 and more.<br/>- Supports languages including Python, Java, Golang, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and more on the way.<br/>- Autofix - Don't just point out bugs, help developers fix them!<br/>- Most importantly, Semgrep makes it easy to write custom rules, no fancy DSL required. This empowers AppSec engineers and developers to detect and block company-specific security bugs and anti-patterns as well as enforce best practices.</p> <p>We\u2019ll demo how to easily write custom Semgrep rules tailored to your specific code base, and how to get continuous security coverage in CI in a just a few minutes.</p> <p>Bio: Clint Gibler (@clintgibler) is the Head of Security Research for r2c, a startup working on giving security tools directly to developers. Previously, Clint was a Research Director at NCC Group, a global security consulting firm, where he helped companies implement security automation and DevSecOps best practices as well as performed penetration tests for companies ranging from large enterprises to new startups. Clint has previously spoken at conferences including BlackHat USA, AppSec USA/EU/Cali, BSidesSF, and many DevSecCons. Clint holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Davis.

        "description": "<p>Today\u2019s software-driven world is built on APIs, which are increasingly becoming the heartbeat of every modern mobile, B2B, IoT, and web application. APIs enable developers to write data-driven and flexible applications that all end-users and organizations require and desire. However, while APIs have clear and obvious benefits, they also create a rapidly-growing attack surface that isn\u2019t widely understood and sometimes completely overlooked by developers. Recent reports suggest that by 2022, API abuses will be the most responsible vector for data breaches within enterprise web applications. Therefore, securing them is a top challenge and must be a top priority. In this talk, we will highlight the security risks presented by the naive use of APIs and why an increased level of awareness is required to mitigate the risks. Next, we will dive into the top 10 API security risks presented in the OWASP API Top 10 list. From API-specific issues like broken object-level authorization and excessive data exposure to more familiar issues like injection risks. The list rounds up the most critical API threats while also providing explanations and example attack scenarios</p> <p>Speaker: Erez Yalon<br/>Erez Yalon, Head of Security Research, oversees Checkmarx\u2019s research team comprising analysts, pen-testers, secure developers, and bug bounty hunters. He brings vast experience to his position, and his efforts empower today\u2019s developers and organizations to deliver more secure software, applications, and devices. Erez is the co-founder of the DEF CON AppSec Village and co-led the development of the OWASP API Security Top 10 list. Over the years, Erez has been invited to speak at prominent events, including RSA Conference, Infosecurity Europe, Black Hat, and DEF CON, while also being featured in news outlets such as Fortune, Forbes, WIRED, TechCrunch, and Dark Reading.</p> <p>Twitter: @ErezYalon<br/>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/erezyalon/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/erezyalon/</a></p> "

Considering usability, initiative design, availability, continuity, time-to-market and all those business driven aspects of modern software development. Unfortunately, security (secure architecture, design and secure development) are hardly considered. This is no wonder, as it is not always clear for developers or business what is meant by security. How to test for security if the context is not clear?</p> <p>To help you design and build (more) security software in the future, this talk will guide you towards understanding how a hacker works, what is a hacker's gain? This presentation will help you to look differently at your applications functionality.

Threat modeling is considered to be a key activity, but can be challenging to perform for developers, and even more so in agile software development. Hence, threat modeling has not seen widespread use in agile software projects.

Cruzes is a Professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Previously, she worked as a senior research scientist at SINTEF in Norway. She has also been a researcher fellow at the University of Maryland and Fraunhofer Center for Experimental Software Engineering-Maryland. Dr. Daniela Cruzes received her PhD in experimental software engineering from the University of Campinas - UNICAMP in Brazil in 2007. Her research interests are empirical software engineering, research methods and theory development, synthesis of SE studies, software security, software testing and agile and DevOps.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;Abstract - Security through an iterative process<br/>Security through an iterative process is a collection of notes collected in 15+ years\u2019 experience. We will go through what has worked for most companies, some myths and some of the common things that are typically missing, but that everybody wants.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Dario Cavallaro has been working in IT Security for over 15 years. Passionate about Linux, Opensource and Security, he has been working in both defensive and offensive security industry. Dario has a Bachelor degree in Computer science, where he focused on Software development and Software engineering. Before that, he collaborated with several opensource projects, like Gentoo.</p> "

        "description": "<p>The next OWASP Timisoara Chapter Meeting will be online.</p> <p>&gt; Summer sessions - Theme: Threat Modeling &amp; Iterative Security</p> <p>&gt; Schedule:<br/>Introduction, OWASP News &amp; Updates - Catalin Curelaru</p> <p>Challenges and Experiences with Threat Modeling in Agile Development Projects - Monica Iovan (Visma) &amp; Daniela S. Cruzes (NTNU)</p> <p>Security through an iterative process - Dario Cavallaro (Cisco)</p> <p>Time: 18:30 to 20:30</p> <p>&gt;&gt;Abstract - Challenges and Experiences with Threat Modeling in Agile Development Projects:<br/>The goal of secure software engineering is to create software that keeps performing as intended even when exposed to attacks. Threat modeling is considered to be a key activity, but can be challenging to perform for developers, and even more so in agile software development. Hence, threat modeling has not seen widespread use in agile software projects. The goal of the presentation is to show some of these challenges and approaches that the teams are working on.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Dr. Monica Iovan, Head of Security Development, Visma; In her free time, Monica enjoys peaceful moments in nature and the company of a good book. She is a passionate researcher having the goal of simplifying the use of security services within Agile development. She leads the security development team in Visma and conducts research on security in agile software development.</p> <p>Dr. Daniela S. Cruzes is a Professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Previously, she worked as a senior research scientist at SINTEF in Norway. She has also been a researcher fellow at the University of Maryland and Fraunhofer Center for Experimental Software Engineering-Maryland. Dr. Daniela Cruzes received her PhD in experimental software engineering from the University of Campinas - UNICAMP in Brazil in 2007. Her research interests are empirical software engineering, research methods and theory development, synthesis of SE studies, software security, software testing and agile and DevOps.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;Abstract - Security through an iterative process<br/>Security through an iterative process is a collection of notes collected in 15+ years\u2019 experience. We will go through what has worked for most companies, some myths and some of the common things that are typically missing, but that everybody wants.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Dario Cavallaro has been working in IT Security for over 15 years. Passionate about Linux, Opensource and Security, he has been working in both defensive and offensive security industry. Dario has a Bachelor degree in Computer science, where he focused on Software development and Software engineering. Before that, he collaborated with several opensource projects, like Gentoo.</p> "

The rapid growth of applications developed in each organization is fueled by the availability of data and rapid development of programming languages and platforms, which make it feasible to create robust applications in a fraction of the time compared to even a few years ago. Combined with a wide range of development methodologies, challenges for Application Security Programs have never been higher.</p> <p>This session will cover some of the latest trends in increasing the effectiveness of Application Security Programs through the lessons learned from the evolution of the OWASP\u2019s Software Assurance Maturity Model. The presentation will include practical suggestions aimed at increasing the ability to measure, manage, and improve Information Security Programs while forming stronger relationships with product owners and developers. The presentation will cover what everyone can expect out of OWASP SAMM 2.0 and what we can all do to help make SAMM 2.0 more helpful and relevant in the future.</p> "

The rapid growth of applications developed in each organization is fueled by the availability of data and rapid development of programming languages and platforms, which make it feasible to create robust applications in a fraction of the time compared to even a few years ago. Combined with a wide range of development methodologies, challenges for Application Security Programs have never been higher.</p> <p>This session will cover some of the latest trends in increasing the effectiveness of Application Security Programs through the lessons learned from the evolution of the OWASP\u2019s Software Assurance Maturity Model. The presentation will include practical suggestions aimed at increasing the ability to measure, manage, and improve Information Security Programs while forming stronger relationships with product owners and developers. The presentation will cover what everyone can expect out of OWASP SAMM 2.0 and what we can all do to help make SAMM 2.0 more helpful and relevant in the future.</p> "
