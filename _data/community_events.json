We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.\" The Internet of today is an amazing place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr. Barlow's original vision.\n\nIn the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis, state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars. We must be free to communicate and associate without fear. To realize our right to privacy and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions. CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to privacy and anonymity online. Topics include technologies like TOR, full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more. CryptoParties are free to attend, public, and not commercially aligned.\n\nPresenter:\nJosh Sokol\n\nAnd others. Please email josh.sokol@owasp.org if you have a 10 minute max presentation on a crypto-oriented subject."

This is done through mini-discussions, demos, presentations, and series of meetings to cover more involved topics (i.e. book topics). Generally the topics will be participant-led, meaning that attendees will volunteer their time to present or lead a discussion, whether a one-time presentation of a topic they wish to review or need help with, or walk through topics of a particular chapter of a book being covered. There will still be OWASP leadership involved with scheduling and such, but the idea is to get a better \u201chands-on\u201d approach to create a more productive learning environment.

It's a foundational part of building a security culture and uncovers potential security issues before they slip into production.\nProactively protecting data from the app to the API requires modeling potential attacks to mitigate weak points before bad actors find them. A team of 15 security veterans and experts, including Chris Romeo, CEO of Security journey, created the Threat Modeling Manifesto. Chris is a veteran security expert focused on developing a security culture through training and education. During this session, he will discuss why a manifesto, how you can use it as a foundational piece of your threat modeling program, and practical application tips for building an Enterprise-class threat modeling program.\n\nBio:\n\nChris Romeo is CEO and co-founder of Security Journey and is a builder of security culture influencing education. His passion is to bring security culture change to all organizations, large and small, by providing gamified security programs. Chris is a highly rated industry speaker and trainer, featured at RSA Conference, OWASP Global AppSec, and ISC2 Security Congress. Chris was the Chief Security Advocate at Cisco for five years, empowering engineers to shift security left in all products and led Cisco\u2019s security belt program (Cisco Security Ninja). Chris has twenty-three years of security experience, holding positions across the gamut, including application security, security engineering, and incident response. Chris holds the CISSP and CSSLP certifications. For more information, see https://www.linkedin.com/in/securityjourney/\nTo book Chris for you event, please contact speaking@securityjourney.com."

        "description": "Happy new year everyone!\n\nOn Thursday the 13th of January we present online a series of lightning talks in English language.\n\nWe'll start with a topic which was hot in December and still may cause headaches. This is followed by an interesting large scale research and we finalize the talk section with the almost mandatory report ;-) on what's new about Juice Shop 13. Any similarity of our presentation date and the Juice Shop version is pure coincidence. ;-)\n\nYou're welcome to stick around after the talks for some networking.\n\nTalks\n=====\n\n1) Thomas Patzke: \"Honeypotting Log4Shell Exploitation Attempts\"\n2) Nurullah Demir: \"Our (in)Secure Web: Understanding Update\nBehavior of Websites and Its Impact on Security\"\n3) Bj\u00f6rn Kimminich: Juice Shop 13: Now with Coding Challenges!\"\n\n1) Abstract: Honeypotting Log4Shell\n--------------------------------------------------\nThe vulnerability CVE-2021-44228 in Log4j (also known as Log4Shell) was disclosed on 2021-12-09. It allows remote code execution with a simple exploit and the vulnerable library Log4j has a high prevalence in many applications. Almost immediately threat actors, researchers, bounty hunters and others started to scan the Internet for vulnerable hosts and some exploited them to gain access to IT environments, deploy coin miners or extend botnets.\n\nIn this talk Thomas will give an overview about Log4Pot, a honeypot developed by various members of the security community to gather data from the exploitation attempts. He will show how the raw data can be turned into insights that are valuable for defenders and how this can be used to detect vulnerable hosts. We will look on real data and see how attackers changed their exploitation attempts and techniques over time. Further, he'll also share some lessons learned while running the honeypot instances.\n\n2) Abstract: Update Behavior of Websites\n---------------------------------------------------------\nSoftware updates take an essential role in keeping IT environments secure. If service providers delay or do not install updates, it can cause unwanted security implications for their environments. This paper conducts a large-scale measurement study of the update behavior of websites and their utilized software stacks. Across 18 months, we analyze over 5.6M websites and 246 distinct client-and server-side software distributions. We found that almost all analyzed sites use outdated software. To understand the possible security implications of outdated software, we analyzed the potential vulnerabilities that affect the utilized software. We show that software components are getting older and more vulnerable because they are not updated. We find that 95 % of the analyzed websites use at least one product for which a vulnerability existed.\n\n3) Abstract: Juice Shop 13\n------------------------------------\nOWASP Juice Shop 13.x has some juicy new features which will be tough to squeeze into a mini-talk, but let's do it anyway! Learn about the latest additions since the last session at OWASP Hamburg Stammtisch, such as:\n\n- Coding Challenges\n- Cheat Detection\n- Challenge Feedback\n- Daily Project Stats\n\nWarning: This talk will skip any basic intro part in favor more new content!\n\nHow to participate\n==================\nOWASP Hamburg Meetup members who RSVP'd for the event will see the URL at the RHS and can join the video conference directly. I'll update the invite URL 1 or 2 days before. The one which matches TBD is not the final one. Just need a password too which you find here. Please make sure when joining you are muted by default to avoid background noise. You're cordially invited to stay longer for socializing, discussion and have e.g. a beer.\n\nWe're using a privacy friendly BigBlueButton instance for these online presentations.\n\nOur OWASP \"Stammtisch\"\n=========================\nOur meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pentesters and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information.\n\nFeel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too. Participation is free and open -- as the O in OWASP.\n\nCheers, Dirk"

GraphQL is a new way of thinking about APIs, while traditionally APIs are structured similar to a database, GraphQL structures it, well, like a graph, where entities and relationships are accessed directly. Although GraphQL was originally released in 2015, it's had a slow burn to becoming a popular alternative to RESTful endpoints, and with the continual advancement of IoT, mobile, and responsive web a tempting alternative. APIs seem deceptively simple, a website designed for computers not humans, returning structured XML or JSON, often they can be an easy entry point for malicious actors. While recent projects like the OWASP API Top 10 are picking up interest around securing APIs and developing API security standards, we are left with a common issue in security, where the tech outpaces the security. So what are the major security concerns of GraphQL? How can you test GraphQL APIs for vulnerabilities? What even is GraphQL anyway? Is this just a human added layer but fundamentally the same stuff with a different API or is this a new paradigm in API security?\n\nIntro: \"Dr Katie Paxton-Fear is a lecturer of cyber security at Manchester Metropolitan University, but she's probably more well known for her hobby: In her free time she's a hacker, she's found 30+ vulnerabilities in real software in production right now!. She got her start in security thanks to a mentorship at a HackerOne live hacking event in 2019 where she found her first two bugs in Uber, despite it being her first time hacking. After being invited to be mentee again in Vegas during DEFCON she realised the privilege she had, and once she got home she started making videos teaching others how to get into hacking. Since then she's made 50+ videos on a range of topics, explaining beginner vulnerabilities, tools, APIs, note-taking, and mobile hacking. She's interested in the intersection of data and web application vulnerabilities and developing understanding from noise\"\n\n18:00-18:50 Toby Irvine\nMistakes, Metrics and Lateral flow tests\nIf you can\u2019t measure it you can\u2019t improve it. But what should we be measuring in security? How do we measure it? Why should I do a PCR Covid test over a lateral flow test if I have symptoms? And how the heck are these related?\u201d\n\nToby is the CEO and the co-founder for Secure Delivery. He has 25 years of experience in secure software engineering, and this can be seen in him unlocking his grey beard wizard level. He has got experience in designing and building large scale on-site and cloud systems across many industries some of those being critical industries. He specializes working with highly regulated organisations. He is also the author of the handbook used by HSBC's Secure Development Handbook, which is a field guide for secure application development for 30,000 software developers across 68 countries. He has trained both technical and non-technical individuals in delivery roles across the Americas, EMEA and APAC. Specifically in modern application security practices. He is a member of OWASP in which he is the project leader for the OWASP Open AppSec Curriculum. He believes in pushing doing right by customers in doing things better. In his spare time he is a musician, and may even have his own Youtube channel. If you have a problem he has probably already encountered it and has the knowledge on how to fix it."

Any business with a mobile app, modern web apps (SPAs), using the cloud, doing a digital transformation, integrating with business partners, running microservices or using kubernetes has APIs. There's a good foundation of AppSec knowledge out there - thanks in part to OWASP but API Security isn't exactly the same as AppSec. Additional complexity is part of the landscape with multiple competing API technologies like REST, gRPC and GraphQL plus stakeholders spread across multiple parts of the business. How to do you make sense of API Security landscape? This talk will cover the three fundamental areas to consider, the various chess pieces and the many ways those pieces can be put on your API chessboard. The goal is for you to leave knowing how to map out your API Security landscape and reach a state of solid API Security.\n\nBIO: Matt Tesauro is a DevSecOps and AppSec guru with specialization in creating security programs, leveraging automation to maximize team velocity and training emerging and senior professionals. When not writing automation code in Go, Matt is pushing for DevSecOps everywhere via his involvement in open-source projects, presentations, trainings and new technology innovation.\n\nAs a versatile engineer, Matt\u2019s background spans software development (primarily web development), Linux system administration, penetration testing and application / cloud security. He thrives on tackling technical problems, but his economics background gives him a unique understanding of business constraints and incentives around security initiatives.\n\nCurrently, as a Distinguished Engineer at Noname Security, Matt is evangelizing Noname\u2019s ground-breaking API security platform and API security in general. Previously, he rolled out AppSec automation at USAA and founded 10Security. Early in his career, Matt served as Director of Community and Operations at the OWASP Foundation, Senior AppSec Engineer at Duo Security, Senior Software Security Engineer at Pearson and Senior Product Security Engineer at Rackspace.\n\nMeeting info will be available on meetup - BE SURE TO RSVP to access the link\n\nATTENTION SPONSORS: YOUR NAME COULD BE HERE\nContact sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

Goel\n20:00 - 20:15 Break\n20:15 - 21:00 Gamification of Threat Modelling by Grant Ongers\n\nA story on scaling threat modeling across 500+ DevOps teams.\n\nThis talk is not about \u201cwhat is threat modelling, and what are the different methodologies?\u201d. This is well known and understood by now. With every organization moving towards DevSecOps, the difficult question is \u201chow to do Threat Modeling at scale?\u201d. I want to take this opportunity to share with you the ABN AMRO story about how we did this!\n\nAbhishek k. Goel is a Security Consultant at ABN Amro and the IT lead for Threat Modelling capability at the bank. He is a senior security engineer responsible for enabling security in DevOps across the bank.\nBefore ABN, he was a Lead Security Consultant with Deloitte USI and enabled security in CICD pipelines for clients across the globe.\n\nGamification of Threat Modelling\n\nThe talk is all about doing security architecture and threat modelling work as part of development planning.\nThe presentation starts by introducing OWASP Cornucopia and the simplified OWASP \u201cTop 5\u201d for developers and then moves into looking at how one can practically include a form of threat modelling (using Cornucopia) into one\u2019s agile development practises in an effective manner.\nThere is a brief discussion on gamification, covering the usual FAQs on that and then it moves onto implementation at scale and some of the experiences we\u2019ve had there.\n\nCo-founder of Secure Delivery and current OWASP Global Foundation board member, Grant Ongers (@rewtd), is a firm believer in security enabling delivery not blocking it. The philosophy and purpose of Secure Delivery is in the name: optimal delivery and security in one nimble and adaptive offering.\nGrant\u2019s experience spans Dev - building platforms for Telcos, MSPs and Financial institutions for more than 10 years. 20+ years in Ops, running operational teams in global NOCs to managing mainframe and database systems. He also has over 30 years pushing the limits of (Info)Sec - mostly white-hat. He\u2019s worked on both sides of the TPSA table, for and with regulated orgs ensuring compliance and matching \u201cappetite for\u201d with \u201cacceptance of\u201d risk.\nGrant\u2019s community involvement is global: Staff at BSides (London, Las Vegas, and Cape Town), Goon at DEF CON (USA) for over a decade and DC2721 co-founder, staff at BlackHat (USA and EU).\nAlongside his role as CTO within Secure Delivery, Grant provides C-suite advice and guidance on security to FTSE100 enterprises and strategic risk analysis within M&A diligence teams.\n\nThis is an online meeting and will be streamed on YouTube."

Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs.\n\nYou may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues.\n\nGartner has actually predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks.\n\nThis session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks.

OWASP Foundation 2022 Update\nAbstract:\nMembers of the OWASP Toronto and Ottawa chapters will give a quick update on what's new with the OWASP Foundation - new flagship projects, membership benefits, initiatives that could use your help!\n\nBios:\nOpheliar Chan spends most of her time trying to make software security more accessible, pragmatic, and FUD-free, both as the lead of Accenture\u2019s Application Security Advisory Services in Canada, and while moonlighting as co-lead of the OWASP Toronto Chapter. For over a decade, she has focused on application security, SDLC process consulting and implementations, program building, penetration testing/vulnerability assessments, and related. You can usually find her in-person at OWASP Toronto Meetups, or at opheliar.chan@owasp.org.\n\nGarth Boyd is a Senior Application Security Architect/Cloud Security Architect specializing in Secure Software Architecture and Ethical Hacking. He supports organizations wishing a designer, creator, and breaker to help them on their security path. A lifelong learner who enjoys crafting solutions to interesting and tough problems through architecture, threat modelling, mitigation design, and penetration testing. Researching new ideas, troubleshooting, communication, and thinking of six impossible things before breakfast are part of the journey. Currently, Garth is the OWASP Ottawa Chapter Leader and an independent consultant working though his own company called Devious Plan. You can reach him at garth.boyd@owasp.org.\n\n2. How to reverse engineer binaries with this one stupid trick\n\nAbstract:\nSoftware vendors often provide only binaries, but security professionals may want to analyze them to look for security flaws. Reverse engineering can help us understand how an executable works. Decompiling can generate call trees and even generate source code. Symbol browsers can be used to find sensitive information. In this presentation, we\u2019ll analyze a binary to understand its authentication procedure, and then modify it. We\u2019ll use Ghidra, an open source tool from the NSA.\n\nBio: Alex deVries\nAlex deVries has a background in security in operating systems, IoT and cloud. The roles he\u2019s played are red team, blue team, incident response and security management. He\u2019s been going to OWASP meetups long enough to remember the free pizza. His day job is a Security Architect at Ericsson, and he just got his CISSP.\n\n3. Analyzing source code for vulnerabilities: A how-to workshop\n\nAbstract:\nWriting code is hard. Writing secure code is even harder. Serious security vulnerabilities often stem from small programming mistakes. As developers, we can safeguard our applications by catching these mistakes in our own code.\n\nPerforming a source code review is one of the best ways to find security issues in code. But how do you do it? In this workshop, we will first go through the basics of how to review your code for vulnerabilities and some tactics for performing an effective security code review on your application.\n\nBut the process of manually analyzing code for vulnerabilities can be very time-consuming. In the second part of this talk, we will also talk about how to use the interactive code analysis tool Joern to make code analysis more efficient. How do you effectively trace user input in code? How can you efficiently link bug sources to sensitive sink functions?\n\nBio: Suchakra\nSuchakra is Staff Scientist at ShiftLeft Inc. where he plays around with large graphs and hunts bugs. He completed his PhD in Computer Engineering from \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al where he worked on eBPF and hardware-assisted tracing techniques for OS analysis. He developed one of the first hardware-trace based VM analysis techniques. He has delivered talks and training at venues such as USENIX LISA, SCALE 18x, Papers We Love, Tracing Summit etc."

Do you have to do a course or be certified? Do I need to set up my own testing lab, and if so, what operating system and tools do I use? Is there a way to learn for free? So many questions. It can feel so overwhelming at times, enough to put you off.\n\nThe aim of this event is to offer an open discussion where we can all share tips, tricks, resources and suggestions around how to go about getting started in Ethical Hacking. Everything from how to make learning fun, recommended resources such as websites, podcasts, gamification sites (CTFs), tools, bug bounty platforms and tips and tricks on how to learn and remain focused.\n\nThis event will be open to members of OWASP Suffolk and other OWASP groups. This event will not be recorded.\n\nAgenda:\n\n* Welcome back & overview of what we have in store for 2022\n* OWASP updates\n* Open discussion on how to get started in Ethical Hacking"

He supports organizations wishing a designer, creator, and breaker to help them on their security path. A lifelong learner who enjoys crafting solutions to interesting and tough problems through architecture, threat modelling, mitigation design, and penetration testing. Researching new ideas, troubleshooting, communication, and thinking of six impossible things before breakfast are part of the journey. Currently, Garth is the OWASP Ottawa Chapter Leader and an independent consultant working though his own company called Devious Plan.\n\nOpheliar Chan spends most of her time trying to make software security more accessible, pragmatic, and FUD-free, both as the lead of Accenture\u2019s Application Security Advisory Services in Canada, and while moonlighting as co-lead of the OWASP Toronto Chapter. For over a decade, she has focused on application security, SDLC process consulting and implementations, program building, penetration testing/vulnerability assessments, and related. You can usually find her in-person at OWASP Toronto Meetups, or at opheliar.chan@owasp.org.\n\nTALK #1\n-----------\n\nHow to reverse engineer binaries with this one stupid trick\n\nSummary:\n\nSoftware vendors often provide only binaries, but security professionals may want to analyze them to look for security flaws. Reverse engineering can help us understand how an executable works. Decompiling can generate call trees and even generate source code. Symbol browsers can be used to find sensitive information. In this presentation, we\u2019ll analyze a binary to understand its authentication procedure, and then modify it. We\u2019ll use Ghidra, an open source tool from the NSA.\n\nPresenter:\n\nAlex DeVries has a background in security in operating systems, IoT and cloud. The roles he\u2019s played are red team, blue team, incident response and security management. He\u2019s been going to OWASP meetups long enough to remember the free pizza. His day job is a Security Architect at Ericsson, and he just got his CISSP.\n\nTALK #2\n-----------\n\nAnalyzing source code for vulnerabilities: A how-to workshop\n\nSummary:\n\nWriting code is hard. Writing secure code is even harder. Serious security vulnerabilities often stem from small programming mistakes. As developers, we can safeguard our applications by catching these mistakes in our own code.\n\nPerforming a source code review is one of the best ways to find security issues in code. But how do you do it? In this workshop, we will first go through the basics of how to review your code for vulnerabilities and some tactics for performing an effective security code review on your application.\n\nBut the process of manually analyzing code for vulnerabilities can be very time-consuming. In the second part of this talk, we will also talk about how to use the interactive code analysis tool Joern to make code analysis more efficient. How do you effectively trace user input in code? How can you efficiently link bug sources to sensitive sink functions?\n\nPresenter:\n\nSuchakra Sharma is Staff Scientist at ShiftLeft Inc. where he plays around with large graphs and hunts bugs. He completed his PhD in Computer Engineering from \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al where he worked on eBPF and hardware-assisted tracing techniques for OS analysis. He developed one of the first hardware-trace based VM analysis techniques. He has delivered talks and training at venues such as USENIX LISA, SCALE 18x, Papers We Love, Tracing Summit etc."
