        "description": "<p>An enterprise API ecosystem is usually complex consisting of internal APIs (built and used by enterprise teams, partners and customers) and external APIs (built by third-parties, but used internally for free or commercially). While enterprises adopt the Zero Trust model, architecting API Security could be cumbersome. Even worse, APIs that crisscross across internal and external networks to access various digital resources, Zero Trust model could simply fall apart very quickly. In this session, we\u2019ll go through various steps of architecting an API Security program that meets the basic tenants of Zero Trust. We\u2019ll highlight various pitfalls that enterprises can avoid while adopting Zero Trust model.</p> <p>Presenter: Dr Baljeet Malhotra (baljeet.malhotra@teejlab.com)</p> <p>Baljeet is an award-winning researcher known for his work in Open Source and API data management.

So what do corporations expect from IT risk management? This presentation gives a very brief historical overview of the topic, presents what ISACA considers to be the best practice and focuses on the role of the \u201c2nd line of defence\u201d in IT risk management and on the process of risk scenario development.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Slaven Smojver is director of the Information Systems Supervision Department in the Croatian National Bank (HNB). The department\u2019s primary responsibility is supervision and assessment of IT risk in credit institutions, e-money institutions, payment institutions, payment systems and FinTech companies. Slaven obtained his Ph.D., M.Sc. and M.Eng.EE degrees from the University of Zagreb, Croatia. He authored several scientific papers and has presented extensively on various topics related to financial services supervision, control and management of information systems and information security in financial institutions. He is CRISC, CISA and CISM in good standing.</p> <p>Talk 2:<br/>----------------<br/>Round table discussion - Log4J</p> <p>Let\u2019s talk and share information about the latest Log4J vulnerability. Bojan \u017ddrnja will give an intro of what we know so far, Vlatko Ko\u0161turjak will show his NSE scanning script, and we will talk about experiences and issues regarding the latest firefighting efforts. Of course, you are invited to share your experiences, findings or concerns.</p> "

Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues.</p> <p>Gartner has actually predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks.</p> <p>This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks.

It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. Companies should adopt this document and start the process of ensuring that their web applications minimize these risks. Using the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps the most effective first step towards changing the software development culture within your organization into one that produces more secure code.</p> <p>The OWASP Top Ten 2021 includes:<br/>- A01:2021-Broken Access Control<br/>- A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures<br/>- A03:2021-Injection<br/>- A04:2021-Insecure Design<br/>- A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration<br/>- A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components<br/>- A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures<br/>- A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures<br/>- A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failure<br/>- A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Jim Manico is the founder of Manicode Security where he trains software developers on secure coding and security engineering. He is also an investor/advisor for Nucleus Security, BitDiscovery, Secure Circle, KSOC and Inspectiv.
