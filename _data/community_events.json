I will discuss technical details and explain the different use cases that might benefit you, from blue team using Sysmon and Cilium/Tetragon to achieve super powerful abilities, to researchers building custom program tracers, to red team exploiting kernel vulns, to sysadmins seeking performance issues.\n\nIt is a truly exciting thing that everyone is talking about.\n\nBio: Kev Sheldrake is a security software engineer and researcher who started working in the technical security field in 1997. Over the years, Kev has been a developer and systems administrator of \u2018secure\u2019 systems, an infosec policy consultant, a penetration tester, a reverse engineer and an entrepreneur who founded and ran his own security consulting company. He currently works at Isovalent on the open source and enterprise versions of the system observability tool Tetragon, and in the past he specialised in IoT, crypto, and tool development for a number of years.\nTwitter: [@kevsecurity](https://twitter.com/kevsecurity)"

Slides of the presentation will be provided, as well as links to resources to continue learning.\n\n**Shane Kell:**\nI started with NetSPI this past January in the NetSPI U program, getting a crash course in Web Application testing for 6 months, and currently work as a Security Consultant testing Web Applications for various clients.\n\nDuring the pandemic I upskilled in several ways. I used TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and TCM to learn and practice new skills. I also found ways to add developing my cyber security skillset to my development plan at work, and this was how I was able to participate in a Vuln Hub hacking group that was hosted by Nike\u2019s Red Team when I was a contractor there. They run it like a book club for hackers, picking a new vuln box every two weeks, show newcomers the ropes, and work on more advanced topics depending on the box that is selected. I also have an associate degree in Computer Information Systems and do my share of hacking on my own time. I am currently learning how to deconstruct, tweak, and recompile Android apps, and how to breach and move laterally within the Active Directory environment.\n\nThere are many free or reasonably priced Cyber Security resources available, and I am happy to share what I know of them."

With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scales.\nEstablishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, light-weight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n**BIO**: Cassio Goldschmidt is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at ServiceTitan and an operating advisor at Bessemer. He is also an investor, startup advisor, MBA mentor, regular speaker at conferences, long-time contributor to the security community, and an award-winning technology executive.\n\n**Sponsor**: Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

Grab a soda, beer, a wine or the like.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWe all have to store our secrets: when it comes to personal passwords in password managers, secrets in CI/CD, or just our runtime secrets required by our online services. But where do you store them? How do you secure them? In this session we present OWASP WrongSecret: a vulnerable app filled with challenges son how to NOT manage your secrets.\nDuring this 45 minute session we explore the project itself, give live demos and give an update on the project in general.\nAre you interested? Hope to see you there!\n\n# Bio\n\nJeroen Willemsen is a Principal Security Architect and one of the project leader of OWASP WrongSecrets. As a more or less a jack of all trades with interest in mobile security, infrastructure security, risk management and application security he loves to research & share knowledge on security topics to anyone who wants to improve the security of their IT stack.\n\n# How to participate\n\nOWASP Hamburg Meetup members who rsvp'd for the event will see the URL at the RHS and can join the video conference directly. I'll update the invite URL \\~ a day before. Also you would need a PIN which you will find here: 961930\n\nPlease make sure when the talk starts your video is off and you are muted.\n\nAgain we will be guest of cyber4edu which provides us with a privacy friendly video conference facility. Thank you!\n\n# Our OWASP \"Stammtisch\"\n\nOur meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pen testers and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information.\nFeel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too.

I will discuss technical details and explain the different use cases that might benefit you, from blue team using Sysmon and Cilium/Tetragon to achieve super powerful abilities, to researchers building custom program tracers, to red team exploiting kernel vulns, to sysadmins seeking performance issues.\n\nIt is a truly exciting thing that everyone is talking about.\n\nBio: Kev Sheldrake is a security software engineer and researcher who started working in the technical security field in 1997. Over the years, Kev has been a developer and systems administrator of \u2018secure\u2019 systems, an infosec policy consultant, a penetration tester, a reverse engineer and an entrepreneur who founded and ran his own security consulting company. He currently works at Isovalent on the open source and enterprise versions of the system observability tool Tetragon, and in the past he specialised in IoT, crypto, and tool development for a number of years.\nTwitter: [@kevsecurity](https://twitter.com/kevsecurity)"

I used TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and TCM to learn and practice new skills. I also found ways to add developing my cyber security skillset to my development plan at work, and this was how I was able to participate in a Vuln Hub hacking group that was hosted by Nike\u2019s Red Team when I was a contractor there. They run it like a book club for hackers, picking a new vuln box every two weeks, show newcomers the ropes, and work on more advanced topics depending on the box that is selected. I also have an associate degree in Computer Information Systems and do my share of hacking on my own time. I am currently learning how to deconstruct, tweak, and recompile Android apps, and how to breach and move laterally within the Active Directory environment.\n\nThere are many free or reasonably priced Cyber Security resources available, and I am happy to share what I know of them."

With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scales.\nEstablishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, light-weight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n**BIO**: Cassio Goldschmidt is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at ServiceTitan and an operating advisor at Bessemer. He is also an investor, startup advisor, MBA mentor, regular speaker at conferences, long-time contributor to the security community, and an award-winning technology executive.\n\n**Sponsor**: Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

It\u2019s a great way to connect with the local Infosec community to get defenders and attackers together to hear about what\u2019s working for others facing the same issues you are facing. Also Airpods will be raffled off to one lucky attendee. Other Swag items will be offered as well, so there is something for everyone. No speaker, just eats and drinks and the summer sun. (Note: In the event of rain, check this page and @synack on Twitter for updates.)"

Grab a soda, beer, a wine or the like.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWe all have to store our secrets: when it comes to personal passwords in password managers, secrets in CI/CD, or just our runtime secrets required by our online services. But where do you store them? How do you secure them? In this session we present OWASP WrongSecret: a vulnerable app filled with challenges son how to NOT manage your secrets.\nDuring this 45 minute session we explore the project itself, give live demos and give an update on the project in general.\nAre you interested? Hope to see you there!\n\n# Bio\n\nJeroen Willemsen is a Principal Security Architect and one of the project leader of OWASP WrongSecrets. As a more or less a jack of all trades with interest in mobile security, infrastructure security, risk management and application security he loves to research & share knowledge on security topics to anyone who wants to improve the security of their IT stack.\n\n# How to participate\n\nOWASP Hamburg Meetup members who rsvp'd for the event will see the URL at the RHS and can join the video conference directly. I'll update the invite URL \\~ a day before. Also you would need a PIN which you will find here: 961930\n\nPlease make sure when the talk starts your video is off and you are muted.\n\nAgain we will be guest of cyber4edu which provides us with a privacy friendly video conference facility. Thank you!\n\n# Our OWASP \"Stammtisch\"\n\nOur meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pen testers and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information.\nFeel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too. Participation is free and open -- as the O in OWASP.\n\nCheers, Dirk"

        "description": "**Speaker:** Ray Kelly, Fellow at Synopsys\n\n**Topic:** Mobile App Vulnerabilities \u2013 The Bad, The Worse And The Ugly\n\nSchedule:\n6:00pm - 6:30pm Networking, Food & Drink sponsored by Synopsys\n6:30pm - 6:35pm Welcome and Introduction\n6:35pm - 7:35pm Presentation\n7:35\\~pm - Raffle (2 gift cards sponsored by Synopsys)\n\nVendors interested in sponsoring send an email to [orange-county-leaders@owasp.org](mailto:orange-county-leaders@owasp.org)\n\n### **Abstract**\n\nOne of today\u2019s hottest targets for hackers is mobile applications. Whether its developer inexperience, rush to market or poor coding techniques, hackers are exploiting mistakes made by mobile app developers and it can be quite costly for companies. In this session you will see attack vectors for mobile apps and real examples of vulnerable public facing apps and how they were exploited.\n\n### **Speaker Bio**\n\nRay Kelly is an internet security professional with over twenty five years of development experience, twenty of which has focused on the internet security space. Ray has been a key player in multiple successfully acquired cyber security start-ups. He was the lead developer and business unit director for WebInspect with SPI Dynamics which is an industry leading application security scanner (later HP and Micro Focus). Ray holds three web application scanning patents and speaks regularly at security conferences. Today, Ray is a Fellow at Synopsys (formally WhiteHat) where he contributes to research, sales and vision of the security product line.\n\n### **Code of Conduct**\n\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

I used TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and TCM to learn and practice new skills. I also found ways to add developing my cyber security skillset to my development plan at work, and this was how I was able to participate in a Vuln Hub hacking group that was hosted by Nike\u2019s Red Team when I was a contractor there. They run it like a book club for hackers, picking a new vuln box every two weeks, show newcomers the ropes, and work on more advanced topics depending on the box that is selected. I also have an associate degree in Computer Information Systems and do my share of hacking on my own time. I am currently learning how to deconstruct, tweak, and recompile Android apps, and how to breach and move laterally within the Active Directory environment.\n\nThere are many free or reasonably priced Cyber Security resources available, and I am happy to share what I know of them."

With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scales.\nEstablishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, light-weight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n**BIO**: Cassio Goldschmidt is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at ServiceTitan and an operating advisor at Bessemer. He is also an investor, startup advisor, MBA mentor, regular speaker at conferences, long-time contributor to the security community, and an award-winning technology executive.\n\n**Sponsor**: Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

In that role I have been responsible for ISO 27001 and GDPR process implementation and certifications.\nAfter joining BEUMER in 2020, I'm responsible for the security in our SW deliveries.\n\nA large part of my job is defining and managing our security program, including Secure Development Lifecycle processes with a virtual team of experts.\n\nI believe I have the necessary patience and persistence and enjoy when my colleagues also see the light of security and processes.\nI have an old master in computer science from AU, followed much later by a diploma in management and latest CISSP and CCSK exams.\n\n**20:00 - 20:45 \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" by Helge Jensen, Full vertical leader: Business, Technology and Cyber Security**\n\nAbout Helge:\nHelge Jensen has built two software consultancies business around data and cyber-security in the energy industries, and is now an angel investor and independent consultant helping change culture and performance of operational security in large enterprises.\n\nAbout the presentation:\nThe session \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" will leave you better prepared for your Cyber Security journey. We will zoom in to specifics via some of the major challenges using IEC62443 (and other standards) to improve cyber security in a frank and direct style. The talk will serve several observations collected in practical settings in the energy industry, and allow raising some of those burning and hard questions.\n\n20:45 - 21:00\nGoodbyes and plans going forward by OWASP Chapter Aarhus"

Grab a soda, beer, a wine or the like.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWe all have to store our secrets: when it comes to personal passwords in password managers, secrets in CI/CD, or just our runtime secrets required by our online services. But where do you store them? How do you secure them? In this session we present OWASP WrongSecret: a vulnerable app filled with challenges son how to NOT manage your secrets.\nDuring this 45 minute session we explore the project itself, give live demos and give an update on the project in general.\nAre you interested? Hope to see you there!\n\n# Bio\n\nJeroen Willemsen is a Principal Security Architect and one of the project leader of OWASP WrongSecrets. As a more or less a jack of all trades with interest in mobile security, infrastructure security, risk management and application security he loves to research & share knowledge on security topics to anyone who wants to improve the security of their IT stack.\n\n# How to participate\n\nOWASP Hamburg Meetup members who rsvp'd for the event will see the URL at the RHS and can join the video conference directly. I'll update the invite URL \\~ a day before. Also you would need a PIN which you will find here: 961930\n\nPlease make sure when the talk starts your video is off and you are muted.\n\nAgain we will be guest of cyber4edu which provides us with a privacy friendly video conference facility. Thank you!\n\n# Our OWASP \"Stammtisch\"\n\nOur meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pen testers and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information.\nFeel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too. Participation is free and open -- as the O in OWASP.\n\nCheers, Dirk"

I will discuss technical details and explain the different use cases that might benefit you, from blue team using Sysmon and Cilium/Tetragon to achieve super powerful abilities, to researchers building custom program tracers, to red team exploiting kernel vulns, to sysadmins seeking performance issues.\n\nIt is a truly exciting thing that everyone is talking about.\n\nBio: Kev Sheldrake is a security software engineer and researcher who started working in the technical security field in 1997. Over the years, Kev has been a developer and systems administrator of \u2018secure\u2019 systems, an infosec policy consultant, a penetration tester, a reverse engineer and an entrepreneur who founded and ran his own security consulting company. He currently works at Isovalent on the open source and enterprise versions of the system observability tool Tetragon, and in the past he specialised in IoT, crypto, and tool development for a number of years.\nTwitter: [@kevsecurity](https://twitter.com/kevsecurity)"

We will be testing against OWASP\u2019s Juice Shop that will be hosted in the cloud, so participants will be able to get some hands-on experience. Slides of the presentation will be provided, as well as links to resources to continue learning.\n\n**Shane Kell:**\nI started with NetSPI this past January in the NetSPI U program, getting a crash course in Web Application testing for 6 months, and currently work as a Security Consultant testing Web Applications for various clients.\n\nDuring the pandemic I upskilled in several ways. I used TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and TCM to learn and practice new skills. I also found ways to add developing my cyber security skillset to my development plan at work, and this was how I was able to participate in a Vuln Hub hacking group that was hosted by Nike\u2019s Red Team when I was a contractor there. They run it like a book club for hackers, picking a new vuln box every two weeks, show newcomers the ropes, and work on more advanced topics depending on the box that is selected. I also have an associate degree in Computer Information Systems and do my share of hacking on my own time. I am currently learning how to deconstruct, tweak, and recompile Android apps, and how to breach and move laterally within the Active Directory environment.\n\nThere are many free or reasonably priced Cyber Security resources available, and I am happy to share what I know of them."

With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scales.\nEstablishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, light-weight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n**BIO**: Cassio Goldschmidt is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at ServiceTitan and an operating advisor at Bessemer. He is also an investor, startup advisor, MBA mentor, regular speaker at conferences, long-time contributor to the security community, and an award-winning technology executive.\n\n**Sponsor**: Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

The standards describes both technical and process-related aspects.\nAgenda:\n\\- Overview of the standards\n\\- How we defined the security program for improving cyber security in our deliveries\n\\- What is the outcome of the first large step\\, leading to process descriptions and the first certificate of compliance\n\\- What are the next steps\n\\- What are our experiences with the standards\\, implementation and certification process\n\nAbout Claus:\nAfter some years as a developer/architect I focused on management and security, and was for some years department manager leading sales, development and operation of security products and services. In that role I have been responsible for ISO 27001 and GDPR process implementation and certifications.\nAfter joining BEUMER in 2020, I'm responsible for the security in our SW deliveries.\n\nA large part of my job is defining and managing our security program, including Secure Development Lifecycle processes with a virtual team of experts.\n\nI believe I have the necessary patience and persistence and enjoy when my colleagues also see the light of security and processes.\nI have an old master in computer science from AU, followed much later by a diploma in management and latest CISSP and CCSK exams.\n\n**20:00 - 20:45 \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" by Helge Jensen, Full vertical leader: Business, Technology and Cyber Security**\n\nAbout Helge:\nHelge Jensen has built two software consultancies business around data and cyber-security in the energy industries, and is now an angel investor and independent consultant helping change culture and performance of operational security in large enterprises.\n\nAbout the presentation:\nThe session \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" will leave you better prepared for your Cyber Security journey. We will zoom in to specifics via some of the major challenges using IEC62443 (and other standards) to improve cyber security in a frank and direct style. The talk will serve several observations collected in practical settings in the energy industry, and allow raising some of those burning and hard questions.\n\n20:45 - 21:00\nGoodbyes and plans going forward by OWASP Chapter Aarhus"

Grab a soda, beer, a wine or the like.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWe all have to store our secrets: when it comes to personal passwords in password managers, secrets in CI/CD, or just our runtime secrets required by our online services. But where do you store them? How do you secure them? In this session we present OWASP WrongSecret: a vulnerable app filled with challenges son how to NOT manage your secrets.\nDuring this 45 minute session we explore the project itself, give live demos and give an update on the project in general.\nAre you interested? Hope to see you there!\n\n# Bio\n\nJeroen Willemsen is a Principal Security Architect and one of the project leader of OWASP WrongSecrets. As a more or less a jack of all trades with interest in mobile security, infrastructure security, risk management and application security he loves to research & share knowledge on security topics to anyone who wants to improve the security of their IT stack.\n\n# How to participate\n\nOWASP Hamburg Meetup members who rsvp'd for the event will see the URL at the RHS and can join the video conference directly. I'll update the invite URL \\~ a day before. Also you would need a PIN which you will find here: 961930\n\nPlease make sure when the talk starts your video is off and you are muted.\n\nAgain we will be guest of cyber4edu which provides us with a privacy friendly video conference facility. Thank you!\n\n# Our OWASP \"Stammtisch\"\n\nOur meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pen testers and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information.\nFeel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too. Participation is free and open -- as the O in OWASP.\n\nCheers, Dirk"

I will discuss technical details and explain the different use cases that might benefit you, from blue team using Sysmon and Cilium/Tetragon to achieve super powerful abilities, to researchers building custom program tracers, to red team exploiting kernel vulns, to sysadmins seeking performance issues.\n\nIt is a truly exciting thing that everyone is talking about.\n\nBio: Kev Sheldrake is a security software engineer and researcher who started working in the technical security field in 1997. Over the years, Kev has been a developer and systems administrator of \u2018secure\u2019 systems, an infosec policy consultant, a penetration tester, a reverse engineer and an entrepreneur who founded and ran his own security consulting company. He currently works at Isovalent on the open source and enterprise versions of the system observability tool Tetragon, and in the past he specialised in IoT, crypto, and tool development for a number of years.\nTwitter: [@kevsecurity](https://twitter.com/kevsecurity)"

I used TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and TCM to learn and practice new skills. I also found ways to add developing my cyber security skillset to my development plan at work, and this was how I was able to participate in a Vuln Hub hacking group that was hosted by Nike\u2019s Red Team when I was a contractor there. They run it like a book club for hackers, picking a new vuln box every two weeks, show newcomers the ropes, and work on more advanced topics depending on the box that is selected. I also have an associate degree in Computer Information Systems and do my share of hacking on my own time. I am currently learning how to deconstruct, tweak, and recompile Android apps, and how to breach and move laterally within the Active Directory environment.\n\nThere are many free or reasonably priced Cyber Security resources available, and I am happy to share what I know of them."

With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scales.\nEstablishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, light-weight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n**BIO**: Cassio Goldschmidt is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at ServiceTitan and an operating advisor at Bessemer. He is also an investor, startup advisor, MBA mentor, regular speaker at conferences, long-time contributor to the security community, and an award-winning technology executive.\n\n**Sponsor**: Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

Grab a soda, beer, a wine or the like.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWe all have to store our secrets: when it comes to personal passwords in password managers, secrets in CI/CD, or just our runtime secrets required by our online services. But where do you store them? How do you secure them? In this session we present OWASP WrongSecret: a vulnerable app filled with challenges son how to NOT manage your secrets.\nDuring this 45 minute session we explore the project itself, give live demos and give an update on the project in general.\nAre you interested? Hope to see you there!\n\n# Bio\n\nJeroen Willemsen is a Principal Security Architect and one of the project leader of OWASP WrongSecrets. As a more or less a jack of all trades with interest in mobile security, infrastructure security, risk management and application security he loves to research & share knowledge on security topics to anyone who wants to improve the security of their IT stack.\n\n# How to participate\n\nOWASP Hamburg Meetup members who rsvp'd for the event will see the URL at the RHS and can join the video conference directly. I'll update the invite URL \\~ a day before. Also you would need a PIN which you will find here: 961930\n\nPlease make sure when the talk starts your video is off and you are muted.\n\nAgain we will be guest of cyber4edu which provides us with a privacy friendly video conference facility. Thank you!\n\n# Our OWASP \"Stammtisch\"\n\nOur meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pen testers and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information.\nFeel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too.

        "description": "Agenda:\n\n* OWASP Updates\n* Talk: What is eBPF and why should you care? with Kev Sheldrake\n* Open discussion\n\nTitle: What is eBPF and why should you care?\nAbstract: eBPF is relatively new and \u201ca revolutionary technology with origins in the Linux kernel that can run sandboxed programs in an operating system kernel.\u201d You can achieve similar results to writing a kernel module, but in a (supposedly \u2013 we\u2019ll come to that) safe manner. eBPF code runs in a virtual machine and, depending on the program type, can access all sorts of kernel internals, with programs being launched when specified code points get hit.\n\nI will talk about the basics and how to get up and running, the challenges and pitfalls to overcome, a library I wrote when working at Sysinternals to take away some of the pain, the Sysmon For Linux tool I wrote for Sysinternals that logs events to Syslog, and Cilium/Tetragon (and Cilium/ebpf library) that makes accessing eBPF for system observability easier. I will discuss technical details and explain the different use cases that might benefit you, from blue team using Sysmon and Cilium/Tetragon to achieve super powerful abilities, to researchers building custom program tracers, to red team exploiting kernel vulns, to sysadmins seeking performance issues.\n\nIt is a truly exciting thing that everyone is talking about.\n\nBio: Kev Sheldrake is a security software engineer and researcher who started working in the technical security field in 1997. Over the years, Kev has been a developer and systems administrator of \u2018secure\u2019 systems, an infosec policy consultant, a penetration tester, a reverse engineer and an entrepreneur who founded and ran his own security consulting company. He currently works at Isovalent on the open source and enterprise versions of the system observability tool Tetragon, and in the past he specialised in IoT, crypto, and tool development for a number of years.\nTwitter: [@kevsecurity](https://twitter.com/kevsecurity)"

We will be testing against OWASP\u2019s Juice Shop that will be hosted in the cloud, so participants will be able to get some hands-on experience. Slides of the presentation will be provided, as well as links to resources to continue learning.\n\n**Shane Kell:**\nI started with NetSPI this past January in the NetSPI U program, getting a crash course in Web Application testing for 6 months, and currently work as a Security Consultant testing Web Applications for various clients.\n\nDuring the pandemic I upskilled in several ways. I used TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and TCM to learn and practice new skills. I also found ways to add developing my cyber security skillset to my development plan at work, and this was how I was able to participate in a Vuln Hub hacking group that was hosted by Nike\u2019s Red Team when I was a contractor there. They run it like a book club for hackers, picking a new vuln box every two weeks, show newcomers the ropes, and work on more advanced topics depending on the box that is selected. I also have an associate degree in Computer Information Systems and do my share of hacking on my own time. I am currently learning how to deconstruct, tweak, and recompile Android apps, and how to breach and move laterally within the Active Directory environment.\n\nThere are many free or reasonably priced Cyber Security resources available, and I am happy to share what I know of them."

        "description": "**TOPIC**: Security for Growth Companies\n\n\\*\\*\\* **NOTE NEW DATE \\*\\*\\*** Join us for great networking, dinner, and see a presentation by [Cassio Goldschmidt](linkedin.com/in/cassiogoldschmidt), the founder of [OWASP Los Angeles](https://www.linkedin.com/company/owaspla/) and CISO at [ServiceTitan](https://www.linkedin.com/company/servicetitan/)\n\n**ABSTRACT**: The increased pressure for cybersecurity practices, even in their earliest stages, is becoming a common demand from both customers and investors. With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scales.\nEstablishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, light-weight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n**BIO**: Cassio Goldschmidt is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at ServiceTitan and an operating advisor at Bessemer. He is also an investor, startup advisor, MBA mentor, regular speaker at conferences, long-time contributor to the security community, and an award-winning technology executive.\n\n**Sponsor**: Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

The standards describes both technical and process-related aspects.\nAgenda:\n\\- Overview of the standards\n\\- How we defined the security program for improving cyber security in our deliveries\n\\- What is the outcome of the first large step\\, leading to process descriptions and the first certificate of compliance\n\\- What are the next steps\n\\- What are our experiences with the standards\\, implementation and certification process\n\nAbout Claus:\nAfter some years as a developer/architect I focused on management and security, and was for some years department manager leading sales, development and operation of security products and services. In that role I have been responsible for ISO 27001 and GDPR process implementation and certifications.\nAfter joining BEUMER in 2020, I'm responsible for the security in our SW deliveries.\n\nA large part of my job is defining and managing our security program, including Secure Development Lifecycle processes with a virtual team of experts.\n\nI believe I have the necessary patience and persistence and enjoy when my colleagues also see the light of security and processes.\nI have an old master in computer science from AU, followed much later by a diploma in management and latest CISSP and CCSK exams.\n\n**20:00 - 20:45 \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" by Helge Jensen, Full vertical leader: Business, Technology and Cyber Security**\n\nAbout Helge:\nHelge Jensen has built two software consultancies business around data and cyber-security in the energy industries, and is now an angel investor and independent consultant helping change culture and performance of operational security in large enterprises.\n\nAbout the presentation:\nThe session \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" will leave you better prepared for your Cyber Security journey. We will zoom in to specifics via some of the major challenges using IEC62443 (and other standards) to improve cyber security in a frank and direct style. The talk will serve several observations collected in practical settings in the energy industry, and allow raising some of those burning and hard questions.\n\n20:45 - 21:00\nGoodbyes and plans going forward by OWASP Chapter Aarhus"

I will discuss technical details and explain the different use cases that might benefit you, from blue team using Sysmon and Cilium/Tetragon to achieve super powerful abilities, to researchers building custom program tracers, to red team exploiting kernel vulns, to sysadmins seeking performance issues.\n\nIt is a truly exciting thing that everyone is talking about.\n\nBio: Kev Sheldrake is a security software engineer and researcher who started working in the technical security field in 1997. Over the years, Kev has been a developer and systems administrator of \u2018secure\u2019 systems, an infosec policy consultant, a penetration tester, a reverse engineer and an entrepreneur who founded and ran his own security consulting company. He currently works at Isovalent on the open source and enterprise versions of the system observability tool Tetragon, and in the past he specialised in IoT, crypto, and tool development for a number of years.\nTwitter: [@kevsecurity](https://twitter.com/kevsecurity)"

We will be testing against OWASP\u2019s Juice Shop that will be hosted in the cloud, so participants will be able to get some hands-on experience. Slides of the presentation will be provided, as well as links to resources to continue learning.\n\n**Shane Kell:**\nI started with NetSPI this past January in the NetSPI U program, getting a crash course in Web Application testing for 6 months, and currently work as a Security Consultant testing Web Applications for various clients.\n\nDuring the pandemic I upskilled in several ways. I used TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and TCM to learn and practice new skills. I also found ways to add developing my cyber security skillset to my development plan at work, and this was how I was able to participate in a Vuln Hub hacking group that was hosted by Nike\u2019s Red Team when I was a contractor there. They run it like a book club for hackers, picking a new vuln box every two weeks, show newcomers the ropes, and work on more advanced topics depending on the box that is selected. I also have an associate degree in Computer Information Systems and do my share of hacking on my own time. I am currently learning how to deconstruct, tweak, and recompile Android apps, and how to breach and move laterally within the Active Directory environment.\n\nThere are many free or reasonably priced Cyber Security resources available, and I am happy to share what I know of them."

With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scales.\nEstablishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, light-weight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n**BIO**: Cassio Goldschmidt is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at ServiceTitan and an operating advisor at Bessemer. He is also an investor, startup advisor, MBA mentor, regular speaker at conferences, long-time contributor to the security community, and an award-winning technology executive.\n\n**Sponsor**: Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

The standards describes both technical and process-related aspects.\nAgenda:\n\\- Overview of the standards\n\\- How we defined the security program for improving cyber security in our deliveries\n\\- What is the outcome of the first large step\\, leading to process descriptions and the first certificate of compliance\n\\- What are the next steps\n\\- What are our experiences with the standards\\, implementation and certification process\n\nAbout Claus:\nAfter some years as a developer/architect I focused on management and security, and was for some years department manager leading sales, development and operation of security products and services. In that role I have been responsible for ISO 27001 and GDPR process implementation and certifications.\nAfter joining BEUMER in 2020, I'm responsible for the security in our SW deliveries.\n\nA large part of my job is defining and managing our security program, including Secure Development Lifecycle processes with a virtual team of experts.\n\nI believe I have the necessary patience and persistence and enjoy when my colleagues also see the light of security and processes.\nI have an old master in computer science from AU, followed much later by a diploma in management and latest CISSP and CCSK exams.\n\n**20:00 - 20:45 \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" by Helge Jensen, Full vertical leader: Business, Technology and Cyber Security**\n\nAbout Helge:\nHelge Jensen has built two software consultancies business around data and cyber-security in the energy industries, and is now an angel investor and independent consultant helping change culture and performance of operational security in large enterprises.\n\nAbout the presentation:\nThe session \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" will leave you better prepared for your Cyber Security journey. We will zoom in to specifics via some of the major challenges using IEC62443 (and other standards) to improve cyber security in a frank and direct style.

With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scales.\nEstablishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, light-weight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n**BIO**: Cassio Goldschmidt is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at ServiceTitan and an operating advisor at Bessemer. He is also an investor, startup advisor, MBA mentor, regular speaker at conferences, long-time contributor to the security community, and an award-winning technology executive.\n\n**Sponsor**: Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

I will discuss technical details and explain the different use cases that might benefit you, from blue team using Sysmon and Cilium/Tetragon to achieve super powerful abilities, to researchers building custom program tracers, to red team exploiting kernel vulns, to sysadmins seeking performance issues.\n\nIt is a truly exciting thing that everyone is talking about.\n\nBio: Kev Sheldrake is a security software engineer and researcher who started working in the technical security field in 1997. Over the years, Kev has been a developer and systems administrator of \u2018secure\u2019 systems, an infosec policy consultant, a penetration tester, a reverse engineer and an entrepreneur who founded and ran his own security consulting company. He currently works at Isovalent on the open source and enterprise versions of the system observability tool Tetragon, and in the past he specialised in IoT, crypto, and tool development for a number of years.\nTwitter: [@kevsecurity](https://twitter.com/kevsecurity)"

We will be testing against OWASP\u2019s Juice Shop that will be hosted in the cloud, so participants will be able to get some hands-on experience. Slides of the presentation will be provided, as well as links to resources to continue learning.\n\n**Shane Kell:**\nI started with NetSPI this past January in the NetSPI U program, getting a crash course in Web Application testing for 6 months, and currently work as a Security Consultant testing Web Applications for various clients.\n\nDuring the pandemic I upskilled in several ways. I used TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and TCM to learn and practice new skills. I also found ways to add developing my cyber security skillset to my development plan at work, and this was how I was able to participate in a Vuln Hub hacking group that was hosted by Nike\u2019s Red Team when I was a contractor there. They run it like a book club for hackers, picking a new vuln box every two weeks, show newcomers the ropes, and work on more advanced topics depending on the box that is selected. I also have an associate degree in Computer Information Systems and do my share of hacking on my own time. I am currently learning how to deconstruct, tweak, and recompile Android apps, and how to breach and move laterally within the Active Directory environment.\n\nThere are many free or reasonably priced Cyber Security resources available, and I am happy to share what I know of them."

With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scales.\nEstablishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, light-weight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n**BIO**: Cassio Goldschmidt is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at ServiceTitan and an operating advisor at Bessemer. He is also an investor, startup advisor, MBA mentor, regular speaker at conferences, long-time contributor to the security community, and an award-winning technology executive.\n\n**Sponsor**: Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

In that role I have been responsible for ISO 27001 and GDPR process implementation and certifications.\nAfter joining BEUMER in 2020, I'm responsible for the security in our SW deliveries.\n\nA large part of my job is defining and managing our security program, including Secure Development Lifecycle processes with a virtual team of experts.\n\nI believe I have the necessary patience and persistence and enjoy when my colleagues also see the light of security and processes.\nI have an old master in computer science from AU, followed much later by a diploma in management and latest CISSP and CCSK exams.\n\n**20:00 - 20:45 \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" by Helge Jensen, Full vertical leader: Business, Technology and Cyber Security**\n\nAbout Helge:\nHelge Jensen has built two software consultancies business around data and cyber-security in the energy industries, and is now an angel investor and independent consultant helping change culture and performance of operational security in large enterprises.\n\nAbout the presentation:\nThe session \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" will leave you better prepared for your Cyber Security journey. We will zoom in to specifics via some of the major challenges using IEC62443 (and other standards) to improve cyber security in a frank and direct style. The talk will serve several observations collected in practical settings in the energy industry, and allow raising some of those burning and hard questions.\n\n20:45 - 21:00\nGoodbyes and plans going forward by OWASP Chapter Aarhus"

        "description": "Hello there,\n\nin two weeks we'll welcome our guest speaker Jeroen Willemsen presenting a little known but cool OWASP project: The OWASP WrongSecrets project!\n\nPlease note due to speaker constraints we'll start a bit later than ususal.\n\nPresentation language will be English.\n\n# TL:DR;)\n\nTitle: \"Introducing OWASP WrongSecrets: How to not handle your secrets!\"\nSpeaker: Jeroen Willemsen\nLocation: Online, please check the link the day before\nStart: 22nd of September 2022, 9:00 pm (CEST)\nNetworking: Stick around afterwards a bit. Grab a soda, beer, a wine or the like.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWe all have to store our secrets: when it comes to personal passwords in password managers, secrets in CI/CD, or just our runtime secrets required by our online services. But where do you store them? How do you secure them? In this session we present OWASP WrongSecret: a vulnerable app filled with challenges son how to NOT manage your secrets.\nDuring this 45 minute session we explore the project itself, give live demos and give an update on the project in general.\nAre you interested? Hope to see you there!\n\n# Bio\n\nJeroen Willemsen is a Principal Security Architect and one of the project leader of OWASP WrongSecrets. As a more or less a jack of all trades with interest in mobile security, infrastructure security, risk management and application security he loves to research & share knowledge on security topics to anyone who wants to improve the security of their IT stack.\n\n# How to participate\n\nOWASP Hamburg Meetup members who rsvp'd for the event will see the URL at the RHS and can join the video conference directly. I'll update the invite URL \\~ a day before. Also you would need a PIN which you will find here: 961930\n\nPlease make sure when the talk starts your video is off and you are muted.\n\nAgain we will be guest of cyber4edu which provides us with a privacy friendly video conference facility. Thank you!\n\n# Our OWASP \"Stammtisch\"\n\nOur meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pen testers and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information.\nFeel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too. Participation is free and open -- as the O in OWASP.\n\nCheers, Dirk"

I will discuss technical details and explain the different use cases that might benefit you, from blue team using Sysmon and Cilium/Tetragon to achieve super powerful abilities, to researchers building custom program tracers, to red team exploiting kernel vulns, to sysadmins seeking performance issues.\n\nIt is a truly exciting thing that everyone is talking about.\n\nBio: Kev Sheldrake is a security software engineer and researcher who started working in the technical security field in 1997. Over the years, Kev has been a developer and systems administrator of \u2018secure\u2019 systems, an infosec policy consultant, a penetration tester, a reverse engineer and an entrepreneur who founded and ran his own security consulting company. He currently works at Isovalent on the open source and enterprise versions of the system observability tool Tetragon, and in the past he specialised in IoT, crypto, and tool development for a number of years.\nTwitter: [@kevsecurity](https://twitter.com/kevsecurity)"

I used TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and TCM to learn and practice new skills. I also found ways to add developing my cyber security skillset to my development plan at work, and this was how I was able to participate in a Vuln Hub hacking group that was hosted by Nike\u2019s Red Team when I was a contractor there. They run it like a book club for hackers, picking a new vuln box every two weeks, show newcomers the ropes, and work on more advanced topics depending on the box that is selected. I also have an associate degree in Computer Information Systems and do my share of hacking on my own time. I am currently learning how to deconstruct, tweak, and recompile Android apps, and how to breach and move laterally within the Active Directory environment.\n\nThere are many free or reasonably priced Cyber Security resources available, and I am happy to share what I know of them."

How do we promote good online safety practice to groups that need it most? Do companies that have the technical expertise in this area have a corporate responsibility to share their knowledge with the public at large? Join this session to see how several organisations have taken onboard that responsibility and have created outreach programs to spread cybersecurity safety knowledge to the following segments in society:\n\n* School students, teachers and parents.\n* Female victims of domestic violence\n* Old age pensioners and the elderly\n\n**Schools and Teachers (The Cybersecurity Academy)**\nJudith Maiers and Evelina P\u00e4rnerud will talk about [the Cybersecurity Academy](https://cybersecurityacademy.se/), a joint initiative with IBM and Young Scientists, which offers training in network security for students and teachers. The aim of the project is to spread knowledge about responsible use of the internet. The initiative provides free lectures by IT experts and teaching materials for schools. The [Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency](https://www.msb.se/) supports the project with funding\n\n**Female Victims of Men's Violence (Digital Freedom For Women)**\nMatilda Sj\u00f6strand and \u00c5sa Holmberg will present the [Digital Women's Freedom](https://www.digitalkvinnofrid.se/) project, which is run by [Sentor](https://www.sentor.se/) and[ Uppsala Women's Shelter](https://www.uppsalakvinnojour.se/) with the aim of protecting women who live under the threat of digital violence, stalking and persecution from men. The project aims to increase the IT and information security skills of women's shelters and other businesses that meet victims of **domestic violence**, as well as to provide women's shelters with concrete tools for enhanced security work.\n\n**Seniors and Pensioners**\nPensioners and the elderly have become a high-risk group in the online community, where their lack of familiarity with the internet and limited technical skills can make them a target for online criminals and scammers. [Bj\u00f6rn Appelgren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bj%C3%B6rn-appelgren-707229103/) from the [Swedish Internet Foundation](https://internetstiftelsen.se/) will discuss the educational material the foundation has produced to help education the elderly in society about the risks and challenges of navigating through their online lives in 2022.\n\n**Speaker Bio:**\n**Judith Maiers**\n[Judith Maiers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/judithmaiers/) works as a project manager at the non-profit organisation Young Scientists ([Unga Forskare](https://ungaforskare.se/)). There she is responsible for the [Cybersecurity Academy](https://cybersecurityacademy.se/), a joint initiative with IBM. The initiative provides free lectures by IT experts and teaching materials for schools. At present, about 15 IT companies are affiliated to the initiative and contribute with volunteer time. The [Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB)](https://www.msb.se/) supports the project with funding.\n\n**Evelina P\u00e4rnerud**\n[Evelina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evelina-p%C3%A4rnerud-99718b16/) leads the IBM CSR work in Northern Europe (the Nordic countries and the Benelux). It is important that everyone in the society has the possibility to take part of the digitalization journey we all are on and therefore the CSR work at IBM has a clear focus on Education & Skills. Evelina drives several initiatives which are focusing on upskilling both youths and adults.

        "description": "Welcome to another physical OWASP Stockholm event!\n\n**Note - Doors Close 17:00 it is important you are at the meeting before 5pm. Some food and light refreshments will be available**\n\nCyber security and online safety has never been more important than it is today. How do we promote good online safety practice to groups that need it most? Do companies that have the technical expertise in this area have a corporate responsibility to share their knowledge with the public at large? Join this session to see how several organisations have taken onboard that responsibility and have created outreach programs to spread cybersecurity safety knowledge to the following segments in society:\n\n* Students, teachers and parents.\n* Female victims of domestic violence\n* The elderly\n\n**Schools and Teachers (The Cybersecurity Academy)**\nJudith Maiers and Evelina P\u00e4rnerud will talk about [the Cybersecurity Academy](https://cybersecurityacademy.se/), a joint initiative with IBM and Young Scientist, which offers training in network security for students and teachers. The aim of the project is to spread knowledge about responsible use of the internet. The initiative provides free lectures by IT experts and teaching materials for schools and is supported by the [Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency](https://www.msb.se/).\n\n**Domestic Violence Victims (Digital Women's Freedom)**\nMatilda Sj\u00f6strand and \u00c5se Holmberg will present the [Digital Women's Freedom](https://www.digitalkvinnofrid.se/) project, which is run by [Sentor](https://www.sentor.se/) and[ Uppsala Women's Shelter](https://www.uppsalakvinnojour.se/) with the aim of protecting women who live under the threat of digital violence, from men. The project aims to increase the IT and information security skills of women's shelters and other businesses that meet victims of **domestic violence**, as well as to provide women's shelters with concrete tools for enhanced security work.\n\n**Seniors and Pensioners**\nPensioners and the elderly have become a high-risk group in the online community, where their lack of familiarity with the internet and limited technical skills can make them a target for online criminals and scammers. [Bj\u00f6rn Appelgren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bj%C3%B6rn-appelgren-707229103/) from the [Swedish Internet Foundation](https://internetstiftelsen.se/) will discuss the educational material the foundation has produced to help education the elderly in society about the risks and challenges of navigating through their online lives in 2022.\n\n**Speaker Bio:**\n**Judith Maiers**\n[Judith Maiers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/judithmaiers/) works as a project manager at the non-profit organisation Young Scientists ([Unga Forskare](https://ungaforskare.se/)).

With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scales.\nEstablishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, light-weight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n**BIO**: Cassio Goldschmidt is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at ServiceTitan and an operating advisor at Bessemer. He is also an investor, startup advisor, MBA mentor, regular speaker at conferences, long-time contributor to the security community, and an award-winning technology executive.\n\n**Sponsor**: Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

Grab a soda, beer, a wine or the like.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWe all have to store our secrets: when it comes to personal passwords in password managers, secrets in CI/CD, or just our runtime secrets required by our online services. But where do you store them? How do you secure them? In this session we present OWASP WrongSecret: a vulnerable app filled with challenges son how to NOT manage your secrets.\nDuring this 45 minute session we explore the project itself, give live demos and give an update on the project in general.\nAre you interested? Hope to see you there!\n\n# Bio\n\nJeroen Willemsen is a Principal Security Architect and one of the project leader of OWASP WrongSecrets. As a more or less a jack of all trades with interest in mobile security, infrastructure security, risk management and application security he loves to research & share knowledge on security topics to anyone who wants to improve the security of their IT stack.\n\n# How to participate\n\nOWASP Hamburg Meetup members who rsvp'd for the event will see the URL at the RHS and can join the video conference directly. I'll update the invite URL \\~ a day before. Also you would need a PIN which you will find here: 961930\n\nPlease make sure when the talk starts your video is off and you are muted.\n\nAgain we will be guest of cyber4edu which provides us with a privacy friendly video conference facility. Thank you!\n\n# Our OWASP \"Stammtisch\"\n\nOur meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pen testers and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information.\nFeel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too. Participation is free and open -- as the O in OWASP.\n\nCheers, Dirk"

I will discuss technical details and explain the different use cases that might benefit you, from blue team using Sysmon and Cilium/Tetragon to achieve super powerful abilities, to researchers building custom program tracers, to red team exploiting kernel vulns, to sysadmins seeking performance issues.\n\nIt is a truly exciting thing that everyone is talking about.\n\nBio: Kev Sheldrake is a security software engineer and researcher who started working in the technical security field in 1997. Over the years, Kev has been a developer and systems administrator of \u2018secure\u2019 systems, an infosec policy consultant, a penetration tester, a reverse engineer and an entrepreneur who founded and ran his own security consulting company. He currently works at Isovalent on the open source and enterprise versions of the system observability tool Tetragon, and in the past he specialised in IoT, crypto, and tool development for a number of years.\nTwitter: [@kevsecurity](https://twitter.com/kevsecurity)"

With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scales.\nEstablishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, light-weight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n**BIO**: Cassio Goldschmidt is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at ServiceTitan and an operating advisor at Bessemer. He is also an investor, startup advisor, MBA mentor, regular speaker at conferences, long-time contributor to the security community, and an award-winning technology executive.\n\n**Sponsor**: Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

The standards describes both technical and process-related aspects.\nAgenda:\n\\- Overview of the standards\n\\- How we defined the security program for improving cyber security in our deliveries\n\\- What is the outcome of the first large step\\, leading to process descriptions and the first certificate of compliance\n\\- What are the next steps\n\\- What are our experiences with the standards\\, implementation and certification process\n\nAbout Claus:\nAfter some years as a developer/architect I focused on management and security, and was for some years department manager leading sales, development and operation of security products and services. In that role I have been responsible for ISO 27001 and GDPR process implementation and certifications.\nAfter joining BEUMER in 2020, I'm responsible for the security in our SW deliveries.\n\nA large part of my job is defining and managing our security program, including Secure Development Lifecycle processes with a virtual team of experts.\n\nI believe I have the necessary patience and persistence and enjoy when my colleagues also see the light of security and processes.\nI have an old master in computer science from AU, followed much later by a diploma in management and latest CISSP and CCSK exams.\n\n**20:00 - 20:45 \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" by Helge Jensen, Full vertical leader: Business, Technology and Cyber Security**\n\nAbout Helge:\nHelge Jensen has built two software consultancies business around data and cyber-security in the energy industries, and is now an angel investor and independent consultant helping change culture and performance of operational security in large enterprises.\n\nAbout the presentation:\nThe session \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" will leave you better prepared for your Cyber Security journey. We will zoom in to specifics via some of the major challenges using IEC62443 (and other standards) to improve cyber security in a frank and direct style. The talk will serve several observations collected in practical settings in the energy industry, and allow raising some of those burning and hard questions.\n\n20:45 - 21:00\nGoodbyes and plans going forward by OWASP Chapter Aarhus"

Grab a soda, beer, a wine or the like.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWe all have to store our secrets: when it comes to personal passwords in password managers, secrets in CI/CD, or just our runtime secrets required by our online services. But where do you store them? How do you secure them? In this session we present OWASP WrongSecret: a vulnerable app filled with challenges son how to NOT manage your secrets.\nDuring this 45 minute session we explore the project itself, give live demos and give an update on the project in general.\nAre you interested? Hope to see you there!\n\n# Bio\n\nJeroen Willemsen is a Principal Security Architect and one of the project leader of OWASP WrongSecrets. As a more or less a jack of all trades with interest in mobile security, infrastructure security, risk management and application security he loves to research & share knowledge on security topics to anyone who wants to improve the security of their IT stack.\n\n# How to participate\n\nOWASP Hamburg Meetup members who rsvp'd for the event will see the URL at the RHS and can join the video conference directly. I'll update the invite URL \\~ a day before. Also you would need a PIN which you will find here: 961930\n\nPlease make sure when the talk starts your video is off and you are muted.\n\nAgain we will be guest of cyber4edu which provides us with a privacy friendly video conference facility. Thank you!\n\n# Our OWASP \"Stammtisch\"\n\nOur meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pen testers and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information.\nFeel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too. Participation is free and open -- as the O in OWASP.\n\nCheers, Dirk"

I will discuss technical details and explain the different use cases that might benefit you, from blue team using Sysmon and Cilium/Tetragon to achieve super powerful abilities, to researchers building custom program tracers, to red team exploiting kernel vulns, to sysadmins seeking performance issues.\n\nIt is a truly exciting thing that everyone is talking about.\n\nBio: Kev Sheldrake is a security software engineer and researcher who started working in the technical security field in 1997. Over the years, Kev has been a developer and systems administrator of \u2018secure\u2019 systems, an infosec policy consultant, a penetration tester, a reverse engineer and an entrepreneur who founded and ran his own security consulting company. He currently works at Isovalent on the open source and enterprise versions of the system observability tool Tetragon, and in the past he specialised in IoT, crypto, and tool development for a number of years.\nTwitter: [@kevsecurity](https://twitter.com/kevsecurity)"

I used TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and TCM to learn and practice new skills. I also found ways to add developing my cyber security skillset to my development plan at work, and this was how I was able to participate in a Vuln Hub hacking group that was hosted by Nike\u2019s Red Team when I was a contractor there. They run it like a book club for hackers, picking a new vuln box every two weeks, show newcomers the ropes, and work on more advanced topics depending on the box that is selected. I also have an associate degree in Computer Information Systems and do my share of hacking on my own time. I am currently learning how to deconstruct, tweak, and recompile Android apps, and how to breach and move laterally within the Active Directory environment.\n\nThere are many free or reasonably priced Cyber Security resources available, and I am happy to share what I know of them."

How do we promote good online safety practice to groups that need it most? Do companies that have the technical expertise in this area have a corporate responsibility to share their knowledge with the public at large? Join this session to see how several organisations have taken onboard that responsibility and have created outreach programs to spread cybersecurity safety knowledge to the following segments in society:\n\n* School students, teachers and parents.\n* Female victims of domestic violence\n* Old age pensioners and the elderly\n\n**Schools and Teachers (The Cybersecurity Academy)**\nJudith Maiers and Evelina P\u00e4rnerud will talk about [the Cybersecurity Academy](https://cybersecurityacademy.se/), a joint initiative with IBM and Young Scientists, which offers training in network security for students and teachers. The aim of the project is to spread knowledge about responsible use of the internet. The initiative provides free lectures by IT experts and teaching materials for schools. The [Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency](https://www.msb.se/) supports the project with funding\n\n**Female Victims of Men's Violence (Digital Freedom For Women)**\nMatilda Sj\u00f6strand and \u00c5sa Holmberg will present the [Digital Women's Freedom](https://www.digitalkvinnofrid.se/) project, which is run by [Sentor](https://www.sentor.se/) and[ Uppsala Women's Shelter](https://www.uppsalakvinnojour.se/) with the aim of protecting women who live under the threat of digital violence, stalking and persecution from men. The project aims to increase the IT and information security skills of women's shelters and other businesses that meet victims of **domestic violence**, as well as to provide women's shelters with concrete tools for enhanced security work.\n\n**Seniors and Pensioners**\nPensioners and the elderly have become a high-risk group in the online community, where their lack of familiarity with the internet and limited technical skills can make them a target for online criminals and scammers.

Some food and light refreshments will be available**\n\nCyber security and online safety has never been more important than it is today. How do we promote good online safety practice to groups that need it most? Do companies that have the technical expertise in this area have a corporate responsibility to share their knowledge with the public at large? Join this session to see how several organisations have taken onboard that responsibility and have created outreach programs to spread cybersecurity safety knowledge to the following segments in society:\n\n* Students, teachers and parents.\n* Female victims of domestic violence\n* The elderly\n\n**Schools and Teachers (The Cybersecurity Academy)**\nJudith Maiers and Evelina P\u00e4rnerud will talk about [the Cybersecurity Academy](https://cybersecurityacademy.se/), a joint initiative with IBM and Young Scientist, which offers training in network security for students and teachers.

The project aims to increase the IT and information security skills of women's shelters and other businesses that meet victims of **domestic violence**, as well as to provide women's shelters with concrete tools for enhanced security work.\n\n**Seniors and Pensioners**\nPensioners and the elderly have become a high-risk group in the online community, where their lack of familiarity with the internet and limited technical skills can make them a target for online criminals and scammers. [Bj\u00f6rn Appelgren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bj%C3%B6rn-appelgren-707229103/) from the [Swedish Internet Foundation](https://internetstiftelsen.se/) will discuss the educational material the foundation has produced to help education the elderly in society about the risks and challenges of navigating through their online lives in 2022.\n\n**Speaker Bio:**\n**Judith Maiers**\n[Judith Maiers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/judithmaiers/) works as a project manager at the non-profit organisation Young Scientists ([Unga Forskare](https://ungaforskare.se/)).

With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scales.\nEstablishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, light-weight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n**BIO**: Cassio Goldschmidt is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at ServiceTitan and an operating advisor at Bessemer. He is also an investor, startup advisor, MBA mentor, regular speaker at conferences, long-time contributor to the security community, and an award-winning technology executive.\n\n**Sponsor**: Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

The standards describes both technical and process-related aspects.\nAgenda:\n\\- Overview of the standards\n\\- How we defined the security program for improving cyber security in our deliveries\n\\- What is the outcome of the first large step\\, leading to process descriptions and the first certificate of compliance\n\\- What are the next steps\n\\- What are our experiences with the standards\\, implementation and certification process\n\nAbout Claus:\nAfter some years as a developer/architect I focused on management and security, and was for some years department manager leading sales, development and operation of security products and services. In that role I have been responsible for ISO 27001 and GDPR process implementation and certifications.\nAfter joining BEUMER in 2020, I'm responsible for the security in our SW deliveries.\n\nA large part of my job is defining and managing our security program, including Secure Development Lifecycle processes with a virtual team of experts.\n\nI believe I have the necessary patience and persistence and enjoy when my colleagues also see the light of security and processes.\nI have an old master in computer science from AU, followed much later by a diploma in management and latest CISSP and CCSK exams.\n\n**20:00 - 20:45 \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" by Helge Jensen, Full vertical leader: Business, Technology and Cyber Security**\n\nAbout Helge:\nHelge Jensen has built two software consultancies business around data and cyber-security in the energy industries, and is now an angel investor and independent consultant helping change culture and performance of operational security in large enterprises.\n\nAbout the presentation:\nThe session \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" will leave you better prepared for your Cyber Security journey. We will zoom in to specifics via some of the major challenges using IEC62443 (and other standards) to improve cyber security in a frank and direct style. The talk will serve several observations collected in practical settings in the energy industry, and allow raising some of those burning and hard questions.\n\n20:45 - 21:00\nGoodbyes and plans going forward by OWASP Chapter Aarhus"

Grab a soda, beer, a wine or the like.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWe all have to store our secrets: when it comes to personal passwords in password managers, secrets in CI/CD, or just our runtime secrets required by our online services. But where do you store them? How do you secure them? In this session we present OWASP WrongSecret: a vulnerable app filled with challenges son how to NOT manage your secrets.\nDuring this 45 minute session we explore the project itself, give live demos and give an update on the project in general.\nAre you interested? Hope to see you there!\n\n# Bio\n\nJeroen Willemsen is a Principal Security Architect and one of the project leader of OWASP WrongSecrets. As a more or less a jack of all trades with interest in mobile security, infrastructure security, risk management and application security he loves to research & share knowledge on security topics to anyone who wants to improve the security of their IT stack.\n\n# How to participate\n\nOWASP Hamburg Meetup members who rsvp'd for the event will see the URL at the RHS and can join the video conference directly. I'll update the invite URL \\~ a day before. Also you would need a PIN which you will find here: 961930\n\nPlease make sure when the talk starts your video is off and you are muted.\n\nAgain we will be guest of cyber4edu which provides us with a privacy friendly video conference facility. Thank you!\n\n# Our OWASP \"Stammtisch\"\n\nOur meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pen testers and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information.\nFeel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too. Participation is free and open -- as the O in OWASP.\n\nCheers, Dirk"

I will discuss technical details and explain the different use cases that might benefit you, from blue team using Sysmon and Cilium/Tetragon to achieve super powerful abilities, to researchers building custom program tracers, to red team exploiting kernel vulns, to sysadmins seeking performance issues.\n\nIt is a truly exciting thing that everyone is talking about.\n\nBio: Kev Sheldrake is a security software engineer and researcher who started working in the technical security field in 1997. Over the years, Kev has been a developer and systems administrator of \u2018secure\u2019 systems, an infosec policy consultant, a penetration tester, a reverse engineer and an entrepreneur who founded and ran his own security consulting company. He currently works at Isovalent on the open source and enterprise versions of the system observability tool Tetragon, and in the past he specialised in IoT, crypto, and tool development for a number of years.\nTwitter: [@kevsecurity](https://twitter.com/kevsecurity)"

We will be testing against OWASP\u2019s Juice Shop that will be hosted in the cloud, so participants will be able to get some hands-on experience. Slides of the presentation will be provided, as well as links to resources to continue learning.\n\n**Shane Kell:**\nI started with NetSPI this past January in the NetSPI U program, getting a crash course in Web Application testing for 6 months, and currently work as a Security Consultant testing Web Applications for various clients.\n\nDuring the pandemic I upskilled in several ways. I used TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and TCM to learn and practice new skills. I also found ways to add developing my cyber security skillset to my development plan at work, and this was how I was able to participate in a Vuln Hub hacking group that was hosted by Nike\u2019s Red Team when I was a contractor there. They run it like a book club for hackers, picking a new vuln box every two weeks, show newcomers the ropes, and work on more advanced topics depending on the box that is selected. I also have an associate degree in Computer Information Systems and do my share of hacking on my own time. I am currently learning how to deconstruct, tweak, and recompile Android apps, and how to breach and move laterally within the Active Directory environment.\n\nThere are many free or reasonably priced Cyber Security resources available, and I am happy to share what I know of them."

With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scales.\nEstablishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, light-weight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n**BIO**: Cassio Goldschmidt is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at ServiceTitan and an operating advisor at Bessemer. He is also an investor, startup advisor, MBA mentor, regular speaker at conferences, long-time contributor to the security community, and an award-winning technology executive.\n\n**Sponsor**: Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

Please let us know if you do not wish to be present in the pictures.\n\n19:00 - 19:30\n\"Welcome, Food and Drinks\" by DEIF and OWASP Chapter Aarhus\n\n**19:30 - 19:45 \u201cIEC 62443\u201d by Claus Riber, Senior Manager, Software Cyber Security at BEUMER Group**\n\nAbout the presentation:\nIEC 62443 is an international series of standards that addresses cybersecurity for operational technology in automation and control systems. The standards describes both technical and process-related aspects.\nAgenda:\n\\- Overview of the standards\n\\- How we defined the security program for improving cyber security in our deliveries\n\\- What is the outcome of the first large step\\, leading to process descriptions and the first certificate of compliance\n\\- What are the next steps\n\\- What are our experiences with the standards\\, implementation and certification process\n\nAbout Claus:\nAfter some years as a developer/architect I focused on management and security, and was for some years department manager leading sales, development and operation of security products and services. In that role I have been responsible for ISO 27001 and GDPR process implementation and certifications.\nAfter joining BEUMER in 2020, I'm responsible for the security in our SW deliveries.\n\nA large part of my job is defining and managing our security program, including Secure Development Lifecycle processes with a virtual team of experts.\n\nI believe I have the necessary patience and persistence and enjoy when my colleagues also see the light of security and processes.\nI have an old master in computer science from AU, followed much later by a diploma in management and latest CISSP and CCSK exams.\n\n**20:00 - 20:45 \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" by Helge Jensen, Full vertical leader: Business, Technology and Cyber Security**\n\nAbout Helge:\nHelge Jensen has built two software consultancies business around data and cyber-security in the energy industries, and is now an angel investor and independent consultant helping change culture and performance of operational security in large enterprises.\n\nAbout the presentation:\nThe session \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" will leave you better prepared for your Cyber Security journey. We will zoom in to specifics via some of the major challenges using IEC62443 (and other standards) to improve cyber security in a frank and direct style. The talk will serve several observations collected in practical settings in the energy industry, and allow raising some of those burning and hard questions.\n\n20:45 - 21:00\nGoodbyes and plans going forward by OWASP Chapter Aarhus"

It\u2019s a great way to connect with the local Infosec community to get defenders and attackers together to hear about what\u2019s working for others facing the same issues you are facing. Also Airpods will be raffled off to one lucky attendee. Other Swag items will be offered as well, so there is something for everyone. No speaker, just eats and drinks and the summer sun.

Grab a soda, beer, a wine or the like.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWe all have to store our secrets: when it comes to personal passwords in password managers, secrets in CI/CD, or just our runtime secrets required by our online services. But where do you store them? How do you secure them? In this session we present OWASP WrongSecret: a vulnerable app filled with challenges son how to NOT manage your secrets.\nDuring this 45 minute session we explore the project itself, give live demos and give an update on the project in general.\nAre you interested? Hope to see you there!\n\n# Bio\n\nJeroen Willemsen is a Principal Security Architect and one of the project leader of OWASP WrongSecrets. As a more or less a jack of all trades with interest in mobile security, infrastructure security, risk management and application security he loves to research & share knowledge on security topics to anyone who wants to improve the security of their IT stack.\n\n# How to participate\n\nOWASP Hamburg Meetup members who rsvp'd for the event will see the URL at the RHS and can join the video conference directly. I'll update the invite URL \\~ a day before. Also you would need a PIN which you will find here: 961930\n\nPlease make sure when the talk starts your video is off and you are muted.\n\nAgain we will be guest of cyber4edu which provides us with a privacy friendly video conference facility. Thank you!\n\n# Our OWASP \"Stammtisch\"\n\nOur meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pen testers and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information.\nFeel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too. Participation is free and open -- as the O in OWASP.\n\nCheers, Dirk"

I will discuss technical details and explain the different use cases that might benefit you, from blue team using Sysmon and Cilium/Tetragon to achieve super powerful abilities, to researchers building custom program tracers, to red team exploiting kernel vulns, to sysadmins seeking performance issues.\n\nIt is a truly exciting thing that everyone is talking about.\n\nBio: Kev Sheldrake is a security software engineer and researcher who started working in the technical security field in 1997. Over the years, Kev has been a developer and systems administrator of \u2018secure\u2019 systems, an infosec policy consultant, a penetration tester, a reverse engineer and an entrepreneur who founded and ran his own security consulting company. He currently works at Isovalent on the open source and enterprise versions of the system observability tool Tetragon, and in the past he specialised in IoT, crypto, and tool development for a number of years.\nTwitter: [@kevsecurity](https://twitter.com/kevsecurity)"

I used TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and TCM to learn and practice new skills. I also found ways to add developing my cyber security skillset to my development plan at work, and this was how I was able to participate in a Vuln Hub hacking group that was hosted by Nike\u2019s Red Team when I was a contractor there. They run it like a book club for hackers, picking a new vuln box every two weeks, show newcomers the ropes, and work on more advanced topics depending on the box that is selected. I also have an associate degree in Computer Information Systems and do my share of hacking on my own time. I am currently learning how to deconstruct, tweak, and recompile Android apps, and how to breach and move laterally within the Active Directory environment.\n\nThere are many free or reasonably priced Cyber Security resources available, and I am happy to share what I know of them."

How do we promote good online safety practice to groups that need it most? Do companies that have the technical expertise in this area have a corporate responsibility to share their knowledge with the public at large? Join this session to see how several organisations have taken onboard that responsibility and have created outreach programs to spread cybersecurity safety knowledge to the following segments in society:\n\n* School students, teachers and parents.\n* Female victims of domestic violence\n* Old age pensioners and the elderly\n\n**Schools and Teachers (The Cybersecurity Academy)**\nJudith Maiers and Evelina P\u00e4rnerud will talk about [the Cybersecurity Academy](https://cybersecurityacademy.se/), a joint initiative with IBM and Young Scientists, which offers training in network security for students and teachers. The aim of the project is to spread knowledge about responsible use of the internet. The initiative provides free lectures by IT experts and teaching materials for schools. The [Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency](https://www.msb.se/) supports the project with funding\n\n**Female Victims of Men's Violence (Digital Freedom For Women)**\nMatilda Sj\u00f6strand and \u00c5sa Holmberg will present the [Digital Women's Freedom](https://www.digitalkvinnofrid.se/) project, which is run by [Sentor](https://www.sentor.se/) and[ Uppsala Women's Shelter](https://www.uppsalakvinnojour.se/) with the aim of protecting women who live under the threat of digital violence, stalking and persecution from men. The project aims to increase the IT and information security skills of women's shelters and other businesses that meet victims of **domestic violence**, as well as to provide women's shelters with concrete tools for enhanced security work.\n\n**Seniors and Pensioners**\nPensioners and the elderly have become a high-risk group in the online community, where their lack of familiarity with the internet and limited technical skills can make them a target for online criminals and scammers. [Bj\u00f6rn Appelgren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bj%C3%B6rn-appelgren-707229103/) from the [Swedish Internet Foundation](https://internetstiftelsen.se/) will discuss the educational material the foundation has produced to help education the elderly in society about the risks and challenges of navigating through their online lives in 2022.\n\n**Speaker Bio:**\n**Judith Maiers**\n[Judith Maiers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/judithmaiers/) works as a project manager at the non-profit organisation Young Scientists ([Unga Forskare](https://ungaforskare.se/)). There she is responsible for the [Cybersecurity Academy](https://cybersecurityacademy.se/), a joint initiative with IBM. The initiative provides free lectures by IT experts and teaching materials for schools. At present, about 15 IT companies are affiliated to the initiative and contribute with volunteer time. The [Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB)](https://www.msb.se/) supports the project with funding.\n\n**Evelina P\u00e4rnerud**\n[Evelina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evelina-p%C3%A4rnerud-99718b16/) leads the IBM CSR work in Northern Europe (the Nordic countries and the Benelux).

Some food and light refreshments will be available**\n\nCyber security and online safety has never been more important than it is today. How do we promote good online safety practice to groups that need it most? Do companies that have the technical expertise in this area have a corporate responsibility to share their knowledge with the public at large? Join this session to see how several organisations have taken onboard that responsibility and have created outreach programs to spread cybersecurity safety knowledge to the following segments in society:\n\n* Students, teachers and parents.\n* Female victims of domestic violence\n* The elderly\n\n**Schools and Teachers (The Cybersecurity Academy)**\nJudith Maiers and Evelina P\u00e4rnerud will talk about [the Cybersecurity Academy](https://cybersecurityacademy.se/), a joint initiative with IBM and Young Scientist, which offers training in network security for students and teachers.

The project aims to increase the IT and information security skills of women's shelters and other businesses that meet victims of **domestic violence**, as well as to provide women's shelters with concrete tools for enhanced security work.\n\n**Seniors and Pensioners**\nPensioners and the elderly have become a high-risk group in the online community, where their lack of familiarity with the internet and limited technical skills can make them a target for online criminals and scammers. [Bj\u00f6rn Appelgren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bj%C3%B6rn-appelgren-707229103/) from the [Swedish Internet Foundation](https://internetstiftelsen.se/) will discuss the educational material the foundation has produced to help education the elderly in society about the risks and challenges of navigating through their online lives in 2022.\n\n**Speaker Bio:**\n**Judith Maiers**\n[Judith Maiers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/judithmaiers/) works as a project manager at the non-profit organisation Young Scientists ([Unga Forskare](https://ungaforskare.se/)).

With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scales.\nEstablishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, light-weight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n**BIO**: Cassio Goldschmidt is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at ServiceTitan and an operating advisor at Bessemer. He is also an investor, startup advisor, MBA mentor, regular speaker at conferences, long-time contributor to the security community, and an award-winning technology executive.\n\n**Sponsor**: Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

The standards describes both technical and process-related aspects.\nAgenda:\n\\- Overview of the standards\n\\- How we defined the security program for improving cyber security in our deliveries\n\\- What is the outcome of the first large step\\, leading to process descriptions and the first certificate of compliance\n\\- What are the next steps\n\\- What are our experiences with the standards\\, implementation and certification process\n\nAbout Claus:\nAfter some years as a developer/architect I focused on management and security, and was for some years department manager leading sales, development and operation of security products and services. In that role I have been responsible for ISO 27001 and GDPR process implementation and certifications.\nAfter joining BEUMER in 2020, I'm responsible for the security in our SW deliveries.\n\nA large part of my job is defining and managing our security program, including Secure Development Lifecycle processes with a virtual team of experts.\n\nI believe I have the necessary patience and persistence and enjoy when my colleagues also see the light of security and processes.\nI have an old master in computer science from AU, followed much later by a diploma in management and latest CISSP and CCSK exams.\n\n**20:00 - 20:45 \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" by Helge Jensen, Full vertical leader: Business, Technology and Cyber Security**\n\nAbout Helge:\nHelge Jensen has built two software consultancies business around data and cyber-security in the energy industries, and is now an angel investor and independent consultant helping change culture and performance of operational security in large enterprises.\n\nAbout the presentation:\nThe session \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" will leave you better prepared for your Cyber Security journey. We will zoom in to specifics via some of the major challenges using IEC62443 (and other standards) to improve cyber security in a frank and direct style. The talk will serve several observations collected in practical settings in the energy industry, and allow raising some of those burning and hard questions.\n\n20:45 - 21:00\nGoodbyes and plans going forward by OWASP Chapter Aarhus"

Grab a soda, beer, a wine or the like.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWe all have to store our secrets: when it comes to personal passwords in password managers, secrets in CI/CD, or just our runtime secrets required by our online services. But where do you store them? How do you secure them? In this session we present OWASP WrongSecret: a vulnerable app filled with challenges son how to NOT manage your secrets.\nDuring this 45 minute session we explore the project itself, give live demos and give an update on the project in general.\nAre you interested? Hope to see you there!\n\n# Bio\n\nJeroen Willemsen is a Principal Security Architect and one of the project leader of OWASP WrongSecrets. As a more or less a jack of all trades with interest in mobile security, infrastructure security, risk management and application security he loves to research & share knowledge on security topics to anyone who wants to improve the security of their IT stack.\n\n# How to participate\n\nOWASP Hamburg Meetup members who rsvp'd for the event will see the URL at the RHS and can join the video conference directly. I'll update the invite URL \\~ a day before. Also you would need a PIN which you will find here: 961930\n\nPlease make sure when the talk starts your video is off and you are muted.\n\nAgain we will be guest of cyber4edu which provides us with a privacy friendly video conference facility. Thank you!\n\n# Our OWASP \"Stammtisch\"\n\nOur meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pen testers and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information.\nFeel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too. Participation is free and open -- as the O in OWASP.\n\nCheers, Dirk"

I will discuss technical details and explain the different use cases that might benefit you, from blue team using Sysmon and Cilium/Tetragon to achieve super powerful abilities, to researchers building custom program tracers, to red team exploiting kernel vulns, to sysadmins seeking performance issues.\n\nIt is a truly exciting thing that everyone is talking about.\n\nBio: Kev Sheldrake is a security software engineer and researcher who started working in the technical security field in 1997. Over the years, Kev has been a developer and systems administrator of \u2018secure\u2019 systems, an infosec policy consultant, a penetration tester, a reverse engineer and an entrepreneur who founded and ran his own security consulting company. He currently works at Isovalent on the open source and enterprise versions of the system observability tool Tetragon, and in the past he specialised in IoT, crypto, and tool development for a number of years.\nTwitter: [@kevsecurity](https://twitter.com/kevsecurity)"

We will be testing against OWASP\u2019s Juice Shop that will be hosted in the cloud, so participants will be able to get some hands-on experience. Slides of the presentation will be provided, as well as links to resources to continue learning.\n\n**Shane Kell:**\nI started with NetSPI this past January in the NetSPI U program, getting a crash course in Web Application testing for 6 months, and currently work as a Security Consultant testing Web Applications for various clients.\n\nDuring the pandemic I upskilled in several ways. I used TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and TCM to learn and practice new skills. I also found ways to add developing my cyber security skillset to my development plan at work, and this was how I was able to participate in a Vuln Hub hacking group that was hosted by Nike\u2019s Red Team when I was a contractor there. They run it like a book club for hackers, picking a new vuln box every two weeks, show newcomers the ropes, and work on more advanced topics depending on the box that is selected. I also have an associate degree in Computer Information Systems and do my share of hacking on my own time. I am currently learning how to deconstruct, tweak, and recompile Android apps, and how to breach and move laterally within the Active Directory environment.\n\nThere are many free or reasonably priced Cyber Security resources available, and I am happy to share what I know of them."

With cyber threats escalating, it\u2019s more urgent than ever to embed security into a company\u2019s day-to-day operations from day one to prevent \u2018security debt\u2019 from emerging as the company scales.\nEstablishing a robust cyber security program can be a daunting task. A cloud-native company faces dozens of cybersecurity tools to choose from and the typical resource constraints of a young company that needs to grow fast. Based on the practical advice given by CISOs of 7 hyper-growth companies (Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, ACV, Axonius, Discord, and ServiceTitan), this talk aims to provide you with a modern, light-weight security guide to succeed in the cloud-first/cloud-native era.\n\n**BIO**: Cassio Goldschmidt is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at ServiceTitan and an operating advisor at Bessemer. He is also an investor, startup advisor, MBA mentor, regular speaker at conferences, long-time contributor to the security community, and an award-winning technology executive.\n\n**Sponsor**: Vendors interested in sponsoring send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org"

The standards describes both technical and process-related aspects.\nAgenda:\n\\- Overview of the standards\n\\- How we defined the security program for improving cyber security in our deliveries\n\\- What is the outcome of the first large step\\, leading to process descriptions and the first certificate of compliance\n\\- What are the next steps\n\\- What are our experiences with the standards\\, implementation and certification process\n\nAbout Claus:\nAfter some years as a developer/architect I focused on management and security, and was for some years department manager leading sales, development and operation of security products and services. In that role I have been responsible for ISO 27001 and GDPR process implementation and certifications.\nAfter joining BEUMER in 2020, I'm responsible for the security in our SW deliveries.\n\nA large part of my job is defining and managing our security program, including Secure Development Lifecycle processes with a virtual team of experts.\n\nI believe I have the necessary patience and persistence and enjoy when my colleagues also see the light of security and processes.\nI have an old master in computer science from AU, followed much later by a diploma in management and latest CISSP and CCSK exams.\n\n**20:00 - 20:45 \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" by Helge Jensen, Full vertical leader: Business, Technology and Cyber Security**\n\nAbout Helge:\nHelge Jensen has built two software consultancies business around data and cyber-security in the energy industries, and is now an angel investor and independent consultant helping change culture and performance of operational security in large enterprises.\n\nAbout the presentation:\nThe session \"IEC62443, Practically executed\" will leave you better prepared for your Cyber Security journey. We will zoom in to specifics via some of the major challenges using IEC62443 (and other standards) to improve cyber security in a frank and direct style. The talk will serve several observations collected in practical settings in the energy industry, and allow raising some of those burning and hard questions.\n\n20:45 - 21:00\nGoodbyes and plans going forward by OWASP Chapter Aarhus"

Also Airpods will be raffled off to one lucky attendee. Other Swag items will be offered as well, so there is something for everyone. No speaker, just eats and drinks and the summer sun.

Grab a soda, beer, a wine or the like.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWe all have to store our secrets: when it comes to personal passwords in password managers, secrets in CI/CD, or just our runtime secrets required by our online services. But where do you store them? How do you secure them? In this session we present OWASP WrongSecret: a vulnerable app filled with challenges son how to NOT manage your secrets.\nDuring this 45 minute session we explore the project itself, give live demos and give an update on the project in general.\nAre you interested? Hope to see you there!\n\n# Bio\n\nJeroen Willemsen is a Principal Security Architect and one of the project leader of OWASP WrongSecrets. As a more or less a jack of all trades with interest in mobile security, infrastructure security, risk management and application security he loves to research & share knowledge on security topics to anyone who wants to improve the security of their IT stack.\n\n# How to participate\n\nOWASP Hamburg Meetup members who rsvp'd for the event will see the URL at the RHS and can join the video conference directly. I'll update the invite URL \\~ a day before. Also you would need a PIN which you will find here: 961930\n\nPlease make sure when the talk starts your video is off and you are muted.\n\nAgain we will be guest of cyber4edu which provides us with a privacy friendly video conference facility. Thank you!\n\n# Our OWASP \"Stammtisch\"\n\nOur meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pen testers and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information.\nFeel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too. Participation is free and open -- as the O in OWASP.\n\nCheers, Dirk"
