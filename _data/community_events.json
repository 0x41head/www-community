        "description": "In the world of vulnerability research & exploit development, much of the public research and findings are primarily centered around the result of said research and activities. However, a lesser known and even lesser publicly talked about part of research is what happens when a bug is discovered where at that current time an abusable condition is not clearly present. What happens? Is this bug now worthless or not worth inspecting further? Many professional teams have a multitude of bugs to analyze specifically from fuzzing campaigns. This can cause teams to have to prioritize certain types of bugs over others, especially when looking for bugs that can lead to bypassing a specific mitigation. They don\u2019t have time to analyze every single bug in depth majority of the time.\u2028\u2028If you are curious about the world of vulnerability research and some of the methodology, this talk aims to help explain a common technique used among research teams where they hold onto potential mitigation breaking bugs in the hopes that in the future an abusable condition become available. We will walk through a real-world example of a bug within the Windows Kernel AFD driver discovered by VerSprite VS-Labs Research team.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nRobert Hawes is the active Director of Research at VerSprite VS-Labs Research team. He Enjoys all things in the area of vulnerability research and exploit development. Robert is passionate about discovering zero-day vulnerabilities and developing accompanying exploits for advance capabilities. Robert is currently focused on userland, and kernel driver exploitation centered around the Windows operating system."

Runtime security tools don\u2019t understand SCA findings, and don\u2019t come in until production. What if you could marry SCA with runtime analysis during dev, test, and prod?\n\nIn this session, we will discuss how the next generation of AppSec needs to go beyond just integrating static SCA into your CI pipeline, to analyzing insecure behaviors inside running apps and correlating that back to SCA to understand which vulnerable components are actually loaded into memory and used by your application. This new approach to AppSec will detect both known vulnerabilities/CVEs with SCA scans and unknown vulnerabilities with runtime analysis. It will then prioritize known vulnerabilities with runtime correlation of SCA findings. End result: you catch most of the key risks in your app, prioritize the key items your devs need to work on without flooding them with alerts, and remove unused components from your containers to burn down your CVE debt rapidly\u2026.and achieve the true mission of AppSec\u2026to empower engineering and security teams to create secure applications.\"\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: *[Deepfactor](https://www.deepfactor.io/)*\n*Deepfactor Developer Security is a new approach to AppSec that is cloud-native and developer-friendly. It helps enterprises address supply chain and DevSecOps initiatives with a unique technology approach that combines SCA (Software Composition Analysis), SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) and Runtime Security.*\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available**\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

Together they have 400 packages. When you run a container scan with an SCA (Software Composition Analysis) tool, you notice that 120 of them have vulnerabilities. Your security team is asking you to fix all the critical and high vulnerabilities, but your dev/DevOps team doesn\u2019t have the cycles. What do you do?\n\nToday, developers and DevOps engineers are being asked to address vulnerabilities and supply chain risks in container images. However, the volume of noisy security alerts often leads to developers ignoring them entirely or wasting valuable sprint time researching \u201cfalse positives.\u201d This session will focus on how security and engineering teams can correlate vulnerabilities with runtime information, prioritize alerts based on usage, and filter out false positives that don\u2019t represent a true exposure of a vulnerability. Understanding runtime information can provide intelligence such as applicability of the CVE to the running environment, reachability, and usage. This session will focus on usage. Prioritizing security updates to only used packages in your container image is a highly effective approach to reducing alert fatigue with your container scans. In addition, your DevOps team can even consider removing some of the unused packages and shrink your container images.\n\nAs an example, the session will include a demonstration of a typical SCA static container scan of a sample open-source test application and then show how an engineering team can filter alerts to reduce the number of vulnerable and used alerts that actually need to be fixed by developers by up to 90%.\n\n**Bio:**\nKiran Kamity is the Founder & CEO of Deepfactor. He is a serial Silicon Valley entrepreneur with a passion for building products that meet a need and make a business impact\u2014with Deepfactor that\u2019s empowering engineering teams to create secure cloud native applications. Prior to Deepfactor, Kiran was the Head of Product at Cisco Cloud BU, Founder/CEO at ContainerX (acquired by Cisco), and the Founder/VP at RingCube (acquired by Citrix). Kiran is a TEDx speaker and loves nature, travel, and food.\n\n**Schedule:**\n6:00pm - 6:40pm Networking, Food & Drink\n6:40pm - 7:40pm Presentation\n7:40pm - 8:00pm Networking\n\n### **Code of Conduct**\n\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

Let's get together and compare notes over beer and pizza.\n\nWe also invite discussion and brainstorming about upcoming chapter activities. Currently we are working on scheduling speakers on the third Thursdays in Sep, Oct, and November. If that goes well, we'll aim to continue on that schedule monthly in the new year. Who would you like to hear speak? What topics would you like to see presented? Are you interested in participating? Stop by and let us know what you think."

        "description": "Web APIs are a common glue that connect people and processes with digital systems all across the globe. Not surprisingly, Web APIs contribute more than 80% of the Internet traffic today. Given the importance of APIs, OWASP has recommended top-10 API specific security vulnerabilities (such as Broken Authentication/Authorization and Excessive Data Exposure problems) that organizations must address to strengthen their security posture. Albeit useful, these API specific vulnerabilities do not necessarily translate to the same business risks. For instance, two APIs from an organization with Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) may pose very different business risks to that organization.\n\nIn this session, we'll talk about API Risk Rating System (ARRS) that maps API specific vulnerabilities to business risks such as Legal/Contractual, Operational, Financial, Reputational and Regulatory. Similar in-principle yet different than Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), the main objective of ARRS is to prioritize API specific vulnerabilities based on their business risks. We'll describe the methodology behind the system developed using thousands of APIs that are being tracked at a global scale. We\u2019ll also share some hands-on practical scenarios.\n\nThe work presented was done by Samantha Sanchez, Jun Hee Lee, Alberto Ciconi and Baljeet Malhotra. Samantha, Jun Hee and Alberto are MSc Cybersecurity students at NYIT. Baljeet is an Adjunct Professor at NYIT, UBC, UVic, UNBC, and CEO of TeejLab Inc.\n\n**Location TBD**"
