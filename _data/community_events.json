Still many developers doesn\u2019t know how to implement security mechanisms and particularly cryptography is a very error prone area. For many cryptography is a black box of math-magic and while that is fine, it\u2019s important to use this black box in a correct manner which is sadly not easy. In this talk I\u2019ll give you an introduction on how to use the cryptography black box and how it can be exploited if not used correct.</p> <p>About Marcus:<br/>My name is Marcus, I\u2019m currently a masters student at Aarhus University with a huge interest in cryptography and the math behind it. Beside university I compete in capture the flag tournaments together with my team (Kalmarunionen), where we look at different security solutions and tries to circumvent the implemented security mechanisms, both crypto and other areas. I also work in the cryptography department of Danske bank and have been programming since I was around the age of 12, where the concept of hiding information in plain sight also found my interest.</p> <p>21:15 - 21:30<br/>Goodbyes and plans going forward<br/>Thomas Ljungberg Kristensen - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus<br/>Dennis Perto - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus</p> "

And when there are recalls of certain ingredients it\u2019s nice to quickly know whether those ingredients are already in your cupboard. Software Bills of Materials enable you to know what\u2019s in the software you consider procuring, and let you quickly know what\u2019s already inside your organization. Of course, you can even use them to understand the risk in the portfolio of software your organization baked itself! Since the May Executive Order on Improving the Nation\u2019s Cybersecurity SBOMs have gotten a lot more attention, but what does it really mean for an organization to make the most of this capability? This talk will help you prepare your organization for the near future when generating, evaluating, and leveraging SBOMs will be expected.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Greg Mohler is a Manager within KPMG's Cyber Defense practice, and has spent the past four years helping over 20 clients solve difficult problems related to DevSecOps, Application Security, and Vulnerability Management.

Similarly, CSA's IoT Working group is dedicated to understanding IoT deployments and defining actionable guidance to secure ecosystems. Their efforts are often used to develop medical security guidelines for developers and manufacturers alike but also to influence IoT security assessment methodologies for later use on commercial IoT certification schemes. This session will provide insights into current project initiatives, including those that directly impact medical devices and how you can save lives by getting involved.</p> <p>BIO: Aaron Guzman is a published author and a technical reviewer for several security books. He is the Head of Product &amp; Application Security with Cisco Meraki where he focuses on building security into enterprise IoT products and crafting designs that keep users safe from compromise. Aaron spearheads many open-source initiatives, raising awareness about IoT hacking and proactive defensive strategies under OWASP\u2019s IoT and Embedded Application Security projects. A co-chair of Cloud Security Alliance\u2019s IoT Working Group, he has extensive public speaking experience delivering conference presentations, training, and workshops globally.

Maybe it is better not to put it in your code, nor in your container. But what about Kubernetes? What about a custom secrets storage solution? Of course, we tried many, sometimes funny, things to get our secrets secured. And luckily we ended up with a combination of safe methods, with Vault at its core. Want to know more? Join us, as we will go through various examples and their challenges!</p> <p>Jeroen Willemsen is a Principal Security Architect at Xebia and a jack of all trades in security. He loves to develop new software, set up DevSecOps support tooling, and help companies with security programs. He enjoys sharing knowledge, which is why he published articles, blogs and gave trainings and talks about various subjects.</p> <p>Doing Security in DevOps, the right way!</p> <p>Automation is not DevSecOps, but without automation there is no DevSecOps! Secret management, SAST, DAST, Pen Testing, Container Security, Secure Config Management etc. are about automating security. But let me ask you, can one reach nirvana in securing DevOps with solely automation? This talk will address ALL dimensions required for doing security in DevOps, so we get it right!</p> <p>Irfaan Santoe is a Global Security Director at Wolters Kluwer advising the Business &amp; IT on the information security ambition &amp; implementation. Prior to Wolters Kluwer, Irfaan was the Global Head of Security Engineering at ABN AMRO bank and lead the security implementation of ABN AMRO\u2019s IT transformation towards DevOps. This transformation program is set to uplift more than 500+ Dev-teams to become DevOps and increasing security without breaking DevOps! Irfaan is a Master in Computer Science (a programmer by heart) and is fascinated by the Inner Science of Yoga &amp; Meditation.</p> <p>The YouTube link will be added to this page.</p> "

Static activities have context and depth, but lack visibility on the true behavior of the software. On the other hand, runtime activities have no direct access to the internals of the application because they follow an external approach.</p> <p>DevOps teams are demanding a more complete picture of the security of the applications, combining static and dynamic activities. In this practical talk, I want to propose a new approach based on runtime observability, that provides not only vulnerabilities and attacks, but also app deployment intelligence, sensitive data visibility, and API discovery capabilities.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Daniel Blazquez leads the technical marketing and developer advocacy practice at Hdiv Security, a VC-funded application security company focused on application security automation. As an ex-Java programmer and recovering corporate strategy professional, Daniel brings a holistic view to the S-SDLC practice: from coding to product management, all the way to growth strategy. His education includes a Computer Science master's and undergrad, and an MBA at UCLA Anderson.</p> <p>Our meeting sponsor, Shiftleft, will provide a $40 Amazon gift card to all attendees who fill out our survey during the meeting.

        "description": "<p>Code analysis is the process of analyzing the code of a program to find security vulnerabilities. It is the most effective way to identify many types of security issues, from injection vulnerabilities to issues like leaked secrets and vulnerable dependencies. But the process of manually analyzing code for vulnerabilities can be very time-consuming. Is there a better way to do this?</p> <p>In this talk, Vickie and Suchakra will demonstrate how to use open-sourced code analysis tool Joern to make code analysis more efficient. How do you effectively trace user input in code? How can you efficiently link bug sources to sensitive sink functions? This is the second edition of How to analyze code for vulnerabilities (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8CNysN-lOM\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8CNysN-lOM</a>), this time, we\u2019ll talk about how to do it efficiently using Joern.</p> <p>VICKIE LI<br/>Vickie Li is the resident developer evangelist at ShiftLeft.
