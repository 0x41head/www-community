Courtesy our sponsors Doppler Inc (https://www.doppler.com/).\n\n[Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/) presents an uncomplicated way to sync, manage, orchestrate, and rotate secrets across any environment or app config with easy to use tools.\n\n**Talk #1**: How proactive collaboration between engineering teams and can Increase the ROI.\nApplication security is a critical area of concern in today's digital landscape, where security breaches and cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly common. Within the industry, prioritization and false positive removal are considered to be among the leading challenges. Despite the pressing need to address these issues, security teams often find themselves spread thin due to limited personnel resources. In addition, development teams often operate in silos and must balance the competing demands of feature development and security concerns. This presentation will explore strategies for bridging the gap between security and development teams, with the goal of improving operational efficiency. . By fostering greater collaboration between security and development teams, we can create a more streamlined and effective process for addressing application security concerns.\n\n**Speaker**: Anshu Bansal is CEO of CloudDefense.ai. He is a serial enterprenur. He also invests into early stage companies. In past, he has worked in companies like Amazon, Microsoft and VMWare in various roles.\n\n**Talk** #2: Automating Security Questionnaires with GPT\n\nA Case Study on Real-World Use Cases and Challenges Summary: In this case study, we'll explore a real-world use case where an LLM-based system is used to automate the process of answering security questionnaires. We'll start by discussing the challenges of accuracy and legality that come with using LLMs in such contexts, including hallucinations, missing information, unanswerable questions, and concerns around intellectual property and confidentiality. Then, we'll walk you through an example generative answering pipeline that uses a state-of-the-art LLM to answer security questionnaire questions with high accuracy and efficiency, while also addressing the legal concerns. By the end of this case study, you'll have a better understanding of how LLMs can be used to solve painful problems in the real world, and what challenges and best practices you need to keep in mind when using them.\n\n**Speaker** :- **Chas Ballew**, CEO and founder of Conveyor\n\n**Talk** 3# AppSec Journey: From Chaos To Order\n\nThe journey to AppSec maturity is fraught with several challenges. The world has changed, with software releases happening at an ever-accelerating pace, there is rampant tool proliferation and data overload, applications are moving to hybrid cloud and multi-cloud environments, monolithic software is giving way to microservices, and open-source adoption is exponentially accelerating. Journey to AppSec maturity needs to consider this unification of AppSec + Cloud Security + Infrastructure security. But today\u2019s AppSec teams depend on a collection of point security products that each represent an overlapping piece of the puzzle and lead to siloed manual processes. This leaves them struggling to gain visibility, insight, and process scale they need to identify and protect the ever-changing and growing application risk surface. This resulting AppSec chaos means applications ship fast without the assurance of shipping securely, leaving organizations at risk of breaches and losses.\n\nThis talk gives a point of view on how to bring order to this chaos by integrating security tools across AppSec and Vulnerability management to realize holistic visibility, accelerating agility, and cross-team collaboration.\n\nThe talk also shares how a community of AppSec experts in the Purple Book Community (www.thepurplebook.club) is organizing AppSecCon 2023 - a virtual conference of AppSec experts to share perspectives about people, process, and technology challenges to AppSec maturity and ways to overcome them as a community.\n\n**Speaker** :- **LingRaj Patil**, Executive Chair at Purple book community"

        "description": "Short Description:\nWe talk a lot about DevSecOps, but what do we really mean when we say that? Nobody really can agree on what it means, and if you listen to vendors it's just security tools embedded in your CI/CD processes. I believe in the original idea of a group of people with backgrounds in development, security, and operations working collaboratively together to build and deploy better, more secure applications. Based on that vision I wrote the DevSecOps Playbook in early 2022 as a list of specific steps that people from all three domains (dev, sec, and ops) can do together. The Playbook is 60 tasks that DevSecOps teams can perform to materially affect their application environments. This presentation will walk the audience through all 55 tasks in the Playbook and show them how to prioritize the tasks for their specific company based on the resources that org has.\n\nLonger Description:\nWhat is DevSecOps? How do I \"do\" it? There's a lot of hype around DevSecOps right now, and getting two people to agree on exactly what it means can be a challenge. Unfortunately, there's a lot of vendor narrative that says it's CI/CD with some security thrown in for good measure, but DevSecOps is a lot more than that! My career was changed by the DevOps movement and I believe that DevSecOps should be built on top of DevOps. What does that mean? Well, what made DevOps so powerful for me in the late 2000's was that it brought together people from different departments to work together. Developers learned more about how to manage the underlying infrastructure, and ops teams learned how to use code to build and manage automation. This was powerful and I believe we can do the same with DevSecOps: bring security teams into the processes and workflows that DevOps built at at the same time those security teams will evolve to understand how operations and development teams work.\nThis talk will cover my DevSecOps Playbook which is an open source step-by-step guide to implementing DevSecOps for any organization. This Playbook is broken down into 5 distinct areas of domain expertise:\nDevelopment Environment\nSource Code Management\nContinuous Integration / Deployment and other Automation\nDeployment Environments\nOrganizational Functions\nThe DevSecOps Playbooks spreads the controls evenly across these 5 domains and highlights that this is a group responsibility. There is also an addendum for compliance frameworks and how they can map to the tasks and controls listed in the Playbook. In this talk I will outline these 5 areas and talk about the different controls and tasks in each. I will also give examples of how to implement a subset of these controls."

We explain a bit about what we have been doing the last few years, what we have found and why we no longer can see pentests, risk-assessments, redteaming or just plain old SMA's as adequate for understanding and securing OT environments or critical infrastructure.\n**The team** consists of Ove Tj\u00f6rnhed, Anastasiya Kornitska, and Oscar Gumaelius. They started working together at Orange Cyberdefence where they built OCD's OT Security field in Sweden from the ground up. Now they are working as a team at Afry X to create and build a OT Security area and help design secure OT environments and help spread the knowledge of OT security.\n\n**19:15 - 20:15: Make the cracker pay. Moving password hashing to the client.**\nOne of the main targets of attackers is exfiltrating the user databases and their password verifiers. Attackers will then try to guess the passwords doing guesses against the verifiers so that they can then try to access other services where the user may have used the same, or similar, credentials. To slow down attackers, password hashing algorithms exist which need huge amounts of memory space and bandwidth along with large processing times. Unfortunately, such algorithms are used commonly on the server to which the clients authenticate making them unusable on many systems and opening the system to Denial of Service attacks. To address this, we can instead require the client (or attacker) to perform the hashing themselves, but how can we do it without introducing new security issues? In this talk he will explain how to modify password based flows to move the brunt of the work away from the server in a secure way. We will also introduce a few techniques to improve the performance of the flows without reducing the security and introduce Clipaha, an open source library providing client-side password hashing which can be helpful in this process.\n**Francisco Blas Izquierdo Riera** **(klondike)** is studying his PhD at Chalmers with sponsoring from MSB through the Resilient IoT project. In his PhD studies, he is trying to use his knowledge of real world problems learned after years of experience working as a pentester and as a CISO to create useful solutions to address them. He is also active doing CTFs as part of ChaGU.\n**20:15 - 21:30:** Over-time (optional)\nHang out, grab something to drink, and discuss security, the weather or anything in between!\n\n[Get tickets to the event!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-goteborg-summer-security-evening-tickets-631496782877?aff=ebdshpsearchautocomplete&keep_tld=1)"

It is meant as an overview of the main OWASP projects.\n\nBio:\nLucas is a long-time OWASP member, having worked in OWASP as a project leader and chapter leader on two continents. He was a member of the OWASP Global Conferences committee and lead the organization of 3 OWASP AppSec conferences in Brazil.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferreira/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferreira/)\nTwitter: @lucassapao\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nTitle: **One-Time Quantum-Resistant Fully-Homomorphic Padding Oracle cryptography trends, buzzwords, and snake oil for 2023**\n\nSpeaker:\nDiogo Sousa\n\nAbstract:\nIn our modern times, cryptography is all around us, even if we don't notice it. We use it when checking our bank statements, buying pig plushies online, or sending stickers to each other on instant messengers. Given its ubiquity, it is, for the most part, taken for granted by developers: import HTTP/crypto/TLS, throw in a certificate from Let's Encrypt, and don't think much about it while relying on (hopefully) safe defaults.\nWhile sticking with well-vetted libraries should work out of the box for most cases, in certain areas, you need to be a bit more knowledgeable, if only to make good decisions about what libraries to use and how to wrangle all the moving parts into a cohesive and secure system.\nCryptography tends to be full of obscure notation that isn't that dissimilar to magic spells, and \"Don't Roll Your Own Crypto\" is an often repeated mantra (many times because of the previous statement). Search results for \"crypto\" have been getting progressively more complicated to navigate, with BTC, XRP, and others taking up all the prime SEO result space.\nThis talk targets a beginner to an intermediate audience and, starting from a brief overview of core tenets (Kerckhoffs's principle, Schneier's Law, the economy of mechanism, theoretical vs. practical security), will expand upon the current challenges and trends in modern cryptography, from FHE to PQC (including explaining what those are), and also highlight common design pitfalls (and their consequences) and how to reduce your snake oil intake.\n\nBio:\nAn opinionated individual with interest in cryptography and its intersection with secure software development.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xdsousa/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xdsousa/)"

These costs are the result of misconfiguration in infrastructure and workloads. One way to proactively identify misconfiguration is through security scanning. The scan results provide us with insights into the security posture of our services over time. However, these scanners treat our resources as static and evaluate misconfiguration only in single instances. To assess the potential impact of misconfiguration in our production environment, we need additional tools. In this talk, we will look at ways Chaos Engineering and Security Experimentation can help us minimise the potential damage of misconfiguration. Chaos Engineering is the process of intentionally introducing fault into a system to test its resilience to failure. Anais will walk you through the principles of Security Chaos Engineering and how it can be used to proactively identify misconfiguration and make our deployment pipeline and services more robust.\n\n**Talk 2: \"It\u2019s Not a Bug It\u2019s Emergent Behaviour - Generative AI, Its Cybersecurity Risks and Benefits\" - Sherif Mansour**\n\nA curated talk on generative AI, where Sherif will present his research findings beginning with an overview of the technology, then discuss its current technical risks, and explore its promising security use cases without making grand claims. Additionally, this talk dive into design considerations when developing web applications utilising generative AI. To conclude, Sherif will introduce open-source software announced during the talk, encouraging attendees to use and investigate them at their own discretion.\n\n**SPEAKERS:**\n\n**Ana\u00efs Urlichs (@urlichsanais)**\n\nAna\u00efs Urlichs is a Developer Advocate at Aqua Security, where she contributes to Aqua\u2019s cloud native open source projects. When she is not advocating DevOps best practices, she runs her own YouTube Channel centered around cloud native technologies. Before joining Aqua, Anais worked as SRE at Civo, a cloud native service provider, where she worked on infrastructure for hundreds of tenant clusters. As OpenUK ambassador, her passion lies in making tools and platforms more accessible to developers and community members.\n\n**Sherif Mansour (@kerberosmansour)**\n\nSherif Mansour is the global director of information security at JustEat Takeaway.com and has been working in the field of information security for 19 years. He was the OWASP chairman and sat on of the OWASP foundations' board for four years. He was also one of the founding governing board members for the OpenSSF Foundation which he represented the OWASP Foundation.

What are the pitfalls and the solutions? How do we avoid that someone else\u2019s security issues become our security problems? And, by all means, let\u2019s learn how to be a bit lazy, and do better with less effort!\n*Bio:*\nCurrently working as Information Security Manager at Canon EMEA, Sebastian has been in IT and Security for over 20 years, covering a multitude of roles ranging from Developer, Security Architect, Auditor and Consultant, before moving into security governance and management, giving him a unique multi-faceted view on today\u2019s InfoSec challenges. He has led multiple security improvement programs and performed maturity assessments for a wide variety of organizations - while continuously asking himself:\"Could we do this in another way?\"\n\n**About containers and their escapes: understanding escape patterns and possibilities**\n*Abstract:*\nContainers have become one of the most common underlying infrastructure for microservice architectures. As such, they can often be part of the external attack surface of enterprise systems and applications (e.g., whenever a web application hosted on a kubernetes cluster is Internet-facing). Thus, it is important to understand what types of (mis)configurations can make containers more vulnerable against attacks of different types. In this talk, Mauricio will deep dive into different techniques that can be used to escape containers. In particular, he will talk about how to escape privileged containers, the usage of different capabilities, the usage of kernel exploits and a few other ways in which attackers may use to gain access to the hosts of the containers.\n*Bio:*\nMauricio Cano is a cloud pentester focused on container technologies. In particular, he focuses on the security of containers and serverless architectures. He has pentested Kubernetes clusters and serverless architectures for several multinational financial institutions. Prior to his security work, he has a background in academia and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Groningen, focused on programming language design and formal methods to ensure correctness. In his spare time, Cano enjoys reading, cooking, and solving puzzles."

Di Indonesia, terdapat banyak peluang riset dan implementasi yang dapat dieksplorasi dalam kedua bidang ini. Dalam tulisan ini, akan dijelaskan secara sistematis mengenai peluang-peluang tersebut.\nPertama-tama, dalam hal riset, Indonesia memiliki potensi besar untuk mengembangkan solusi IoT dan AI yang dapat diterapkan dalam berbagai sektor. Contohnya, dalam sektor pertanian, IoT dapat digunakan untuk memantau dan mengoptimalkan kondisi pertanian seperti kelembaban tanah, suhu, dan kualitas air. Dengan adanya AI, data yang terkumpul dari sensor-sensor tersebut dapat dianalisis secara cerdas untuk memberikan rekomendasi tentang pemupukan, irigasi, dan perlindungan tanaman. Riset semacam ini akan memberikan kontribusi signifikan dalam meningkatkan produktivitas pertanian di Indonesia.\nSelain itu, dalam sektor kesehatan, ada peluang besar untuk mengintegrasikan IoT dan AI dalam pengembangan solusi perawatan kesehatan yang lebih efisien. Misalnya, dengan memanfaatkan sensor-sensor yang terhubung dengan internet, kita dapat memantau pasien jarak jauh dan mendeteksi secara dini perkembangan penyakit tertentu. AI dapat digunakan untuk menganalisis data medis dan memberikan diagnosis yang lebih akurat. Peluang riset semacam ini dapat meningkatkan aksesibilitas dan kualitas layanan kesehatan di Indonesia, terutama di daerah yang sulit dijangkau.\nSelain sektor pertanian dan kesehatan, ada juga peluang riset dan implementasi IoT dan AI dalam sektor energi, transportasi, manufaktur, dan smart city. Dalam sektor energi, IoT dapat digunakan untuk mengoptimalkan penggunaan energi di gedung-gedung dan infrastruktur publik. AI dapat membantu dalam menganalisis pola konsumsi energi dan mengidentifikasi strategi penghematan energi yang efektif. Dalam sektor transportasi, IoT dapat digunakan untuk meningkatkan keamanan dan efisiensi transportasi melalui monitoring lalu lintas dan sistem manajemen logistik yang terhubung. Dalam sektor manufaktur, IoT dan AI dapat digunakan untuk mengoptimalkan rantai pasok, memprediksi kerusakan mesin, dan meningkatkan efisiensi produksi. Dalam sektor smart city, IoT dan AI dapat digunakan untuk meningkatkan pengelolaan limbah, pengaturan parkir, dan keamanan publik.\nDalam rangka mengembangkan potensi riset dan implementasi IoT dan AI di Indonesia, penting untuk mendorong kolaborasi antara akademisi, pemerintah, dan sektor industri. Dukungan kebijakan dan regulasi yang jelas juga diperlukan untuk mendorong adopsi teknologi ini. Selain itu, investasi dalam infrastruktur digital dan peningkatan literasi teknologi juga harus menjadi prioritas.\nSecara keseluruhan, peluang riset dan implementasi IoT dan AI di Indonesia sangatlah besar."
