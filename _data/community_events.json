        "description": "<p>An enterprise API ecosystem is usually complex consisting of internal APIs (built and used by enterprise teams, partners and customers) and external APIs (built by third-parties, but used internally for free or commercially). While enterprises adopt the Zero Trust model, architecting API Security could be cumbersome. Even worse, APIs that crisscross across internal and external networks to access various digital resources, Zero Trust model could simply fall apart very quickly. In this session, we\u2019ll go through various steps of architecting an API Security program that meets the basic tenants of Zero Trust. We\u2019ll highlight various pitfalls that enterprises can avoid while adopting Zero Trust model.</p> <p>Presenter: Dr Baljeet Malhotra (baljeet.malhotra@teejlab.com)</p> <p>Baljeet is an award-winning researcher known for his work in Open Source and API data management. He conceptualized world's first \"API Composition Analysis\" based on source code static analysis.

The topics will be delivered virtually, over Google Meet.</p> <p>We have two topics this week:<br/>- Slaven Smojver - IT Risk Management: What a (Competent) Corporation Wants?<br/>- Round table discussion - Log4J / Log4Shell</p> <p>See you!<br/>Talk abstracts and bios follow:</p> <p>Talk 1:<br/>----------------<br/>Slaven Smojver: IT Risk Management: What a (Competent) Corporation Wants?</p> <p>Short description:<br/>Risk management is the backbone of prudent business decision-making. So what do corporations expect from IT risk management? This presentation gives a very brief historical overview of the topic, presents what ISACA considers to be the best practice and focuses on the role of the \u201c2nd line of defence\u201d in IT risk management and on the process of risk scenario development.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Slaven Smojver is director of the Information Systems Supervision Department in the Croatian National Bank (HNB). The department\u2019s primary responsibility is supervision and assessment of IT risk in credit institutions, e-money institutions, payment institutions, payment systems and FinTech companies. Slaven obtained his Ph.D., M.Sc. and M.Eng.EE degrees from the University of Zagreb, Croatia. He authored several scientific papers and has presented extensively on various topics related to financial services supervision, control and management of information systems and information security in financial institutions. He is CRISC, CISA and CISM in good standing.</p> <p>Talk 2:<br/>----------------<br/>Round table discussion - Log4J</p> <p>Let\u2019s talk and share information about the latest Log4J vulnerability. Bojan \u017ddrnja will give an intro of what we know so far, Vlatko Ko\u0161turjak will show his NSE scanning script, and we will talk about experiences and issues regarding the latest firefighting efforts. Of course, you are invited to share your experiences, findings or concerns.</p> "

Learn about the latest additions since the last session at OWASP Hamburg Stammtisch, such as:</p> <p>- Coding Challenges<br/>- Cheat Detection<br/>- Challenge Feedback<br/>- Daily Project Stats</p> <p>Warning: This talk will skip any basic intro part in favor more new content!</p> <p>2) Abstract:<br/>----------------<br/>Software updates take an essential role in keeping IT environments secure. If service providers delay or do not install updates, it can cause unwanted security implications for their environments. This paper conducts a large-scale measurement study of the update behavior of websites and their utilized software stacks. Across 18 months, we analyze over 5.6M websites and 246 distinct client-and server-side software distributions. We found that almost all analyzed sites use outdated software. To understand the possible security implications of outdated software, we analyze the potential vulnerabilities that affect the utilized software. We show that software components are getting older and more vulnerable because they are not updated. We find that 95 % of the analyzed websites use at least one product for which a vulnerability existed.</p> <p>Until then: have a great holiday season and all the best for 2022!</p> <p>Cheers, Dirk</p> "

Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs.</p> <p>You may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues.</p> <p>Gartner has actually predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks.</p> <p>This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks.
