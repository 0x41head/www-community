# GSoC2020 Ideas

## OWASP Project Requests

Tips to get you started in no particular order:
- Read the [Student Guidelines](gsoc2020).
- Contact us through the mailing list or irc channel.
- Check our [github organization](https://github.com/OWASP).

## List of Project Ideas

### [OWASP Python Honeypot](https://github.com/zdresearch/OWASP-Honeypot)

#### [Explanation of Ideas]

OWASP Honeypot is an open source software in Python language which designed for creating honeypot and honeynet in an easy and secure way! This project is compatible with Python 2.x and 3.x and tested on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

#### [Expected Results]

* Zero Bugs: Currently we may have several bugs in different conditions, and it's best to test the all functions and fix them
* New modules: add some creative ICS/Network/Web modules andvulnerable web applications, services and stuff
* API: update API sync to all features
* WebUI: Demonstrate and add API on WebUI and Live version with all features
* WebUI Special Reports: Track the attacks more creative and provide high risk IPs
* Database: Better database structure, faster and use queue
* Data analysis: Analysis stored data and attack signatures
* OWASP Top 10: Preparing useful processed/raw data for OWASP top 10 project

#### [Getting Started]

It's best to start from GitHub [wiki page](https://github.com/zdresearch/OWASP-Honeypot/wiki), we are looking forward to adding more modules and optimize the core.

##### Students Requirements

* Python
* Packet Analysis & Tshark & Libpcap
* Docker
* Database
* Web Development Skills
* Honeypot and Deception knowledge

### [OWASP Security Knowledge Framework](https://github.com/zdresearch/OWASP-Honeypot)

#### [Explanation of Ideas]

OWASP-SKF is an open source security knowledgebase including manageble projects with checklists (ASVS / MASVS) and best practice code examples in multiple programming languages showing you how to prevent hackers gaining access and running exploits on your application. Develop your projects secure by design from the start using SKF.

In a nutshell
* Training your developers in writing secure code
* Security by design, early feedback of possible security issues
* Code examples for secure coding guidance
* Knowledge base items for deeper understanding of the security controls
* Security labs to improve your verification skills
* Machine learning chatbot for easy support

#### [Expected Results]

* New Angular (7/8) GUI for the SKF project. We have this style and GUI for some years now and it could use a major revamp.
* * Create a new style / design for the SKF project
* * We want to keep the color schema that we currently have
* * Create new styles for the different pages and functionality we have in SKF
* * Make it also mobile friendly
* Test cases for the new created Angular application.
* * We believe strongly in automation and testing of the quality of our project, we want to have at least 90% coverage of automated testing for the new Angular frond-end application of SKF


#### [Getting Started]

Have a look at our GitHub [wiki page](https://github.com/blabla1337/skf-flask), run the SKF project and have a look at the Angular interface and the functionality. If you have questions or want to contact us please join us on Slack or Gitter:
