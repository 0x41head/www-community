# GSoC2020 Ideas

## OWASP Project Requests

Tips to get you started in no particular order:
- Read the [Student Guidelines](gsoc2020).
- Contact us through the mailing list or irc channel.
- Check our [github organization](https://github.com/OWASP).

## List of Project Ideas

### [OWASP Python Honeypot](https://github.com/zdresearch/OWASP-Honeypot)

#### [Explanation of Ideas]

OWASP Honeypot is an open source software in Python language which designed for creating honeypot and honeynet in an easy and secure way! This project is compatible with Python 2.x and 3.x and tested on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

#### [Expected Results]

* Zero Bugs: Currently we may have several bugs in different conditions, and it's best to test the all functions and fix them
* New modules: add some creative ICS/Network/Web modules andvulnerable web applications, services and stuff
* API: update API sync to all features
* WebUI: Demonstrate and add API on WebUI and Live version with all features
* WebUI Special Reports: Track the attacks more creative and provide high risk IPs
* Database: Better database structure, faster and use queue
* Data analysis: Analysis stored data and attack signatures
* OWASP Top 10: Preparing useful processed/raw data for OWASP top 10 project

#### [Getting Started]

It's best to start from GitHub [wiki page](https://github.com/zdresearch/OWASP-Honeypot/wiki), we are looking forward to adding more modules and optimize the core.

##### Students Requirements

* Python
* Packet Analysis & Tshark & Libpcap
* Docker
* Database
* Web Development Skills
* Honeypot and Deception knowledge

#### [Mentors]
* [Ali Razmjoo](mailto:ali.razmjoo@owasp.org)

### [Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)](https://www.zaproxy.org)

#### Idea One: GraphQL Support

ZAP does not currently detect [GraphQL weaknesses](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5153) such as injection, auth problems, or information exposures.

#### [Expected Results]

* Implement functionality to allow ZAP to inspect and attack given GraphQL endpoints.
* Code that conforms to our Development Rules and Guidelines

#### [Getting Started]

* Have a look at the ZAP [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) guideline, especially the 'Coding' section.
* We like to see students who have already contributed to ZAP, so try fixing one of the bugs flagged as [IdealFirstBug](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/labels/IdealFirstBug).

#### [Mentors]
* [Simon Bennetts](mailto:psiinon@gmail.com) and the ZAP core team.

#### Idea Two: SSRF Detection/Handling

ZAP is currently able to detect vulnerabilities with limited local network callback support (such as XXE).
ZAP could benefit from enhanced callback support in the form of a configurable or deployable daemon/listener to facilitate 
more external or public callbacks in order to improve [detection of SSRF](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3022) and other related vulnerabilities.

https://ssrfdetector.com/ was an online service for detecting Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities.
It was developed and maintained by Jake Reynolds and is open source https://github.com/jacobreynolds/ssrfdetector 
It may be used for inspiration/ideas as well as other projects such as sleepy-puppy (Netflix), etc. 

#### [Expected Results]

* Create or suggest a suitable alternative to SSRFDetector, and integrate it with ZAP in order to be able to detect SSRF vulnerabilities
* Code that conforms to our Development Rules and Guidelines

#### [Getting Started]

* Have a look at the ZAP [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) guideline, especially the 'Coding' section.
* We like to see students who have already contributed to ZAP, so try fixing one of the bugs flagged as [IdealFirstBug](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/labels/IdealFirstBug).

#### [Mentors]
* [Simon Bennetts](mailto:psiinon@gmail.com) and the ZAP core team.

#### Idea Three: Your Idea

ZAP is a great framework for building new and innovative security testing solutions. If you have an idea that is not on this list then donâ€™t worry, you can still submit it, we have accepted original projects in previous years and have even paid a student to work on their idea when we did not get enough GSoC slots to accept all of the projects we wanted.

#### [Expected Results]

* A new feature that makes ZAP even better
* Code that conforms to our Development Rules and Guidelines

#### [Getting Started]

* Have a look at the ZAP [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) guideline, especially the 'Coding' section.
* We like to see students who have already contributed to ZAP, so try fixing one of the bugs flagged as [IdealFirstBug](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/labels/IdealFirstBug).

#### [Mentors]
