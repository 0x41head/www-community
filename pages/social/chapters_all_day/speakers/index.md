### Is Your Phone Your Enemy or Your Friend?
*Silvia Arias Becker and Oscar Orellana Artigas*

#### Abstract

In this presentation, we will provide information related to the risks you are exposed to through the apps you download to your mobile. We will review the OWASP Mobile Top 10 and use them in real APK analysis. If you are using your mobile more than ever for social media and even for work, this is the presentation you need in your life now!

Telephone devices have become our biggest repository of personal and private information, containing our banking and social network data. They allow us to read news and choose the type of information we want to read, creating a clear profile of our tastes and preferences.  They also store the personal data of our family and people with whom we interact frequently.

All of the above is great, if it is under our control and we can privately isolate that personal information. So what happens if our phone's operating system decides to publish that data or share it so other entities can access and know our tastes and everything that we thought was private?

### Your Taxes Are Being Leaked
*Michael Wylie*

#### Abstract

80% of U.S. small business accounting data is entered and stored on one vendor's software. Major professional CPA firms around the world use this vendor's tax preparation software and trust that the security controls are doing their job. During a Penetration Test, I discovered, and responsibly disclosed to the vendor, a critical unauthenticated information leak vulnerability in the way the software transfers customer data between client and server. This vulnerability exposes all customers' names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, job, spouse information, and more. After further testing, it became clear that the problem was bigger than just one piece of software in one industry, as multiple CVEs were discovered during testing.

## Hour 10 - Hosted by OWASP Santa Barbara (CA, USA)

### Session Host: Walter Mart&iacute;n Villalba, *Chapter Leader*

### HTTP Security Headers
*Walter Mart&iacute;n Villalba - Chapter Leader, OWASP Santa Barbara*

#### Abstract

HTTP headers let web clients and servers exchange additional information (usually metadata) in HTTP messages. HTTP *security* headers define whether a set of security mechanisms should be enabled on the web client. They are a fundamental part of web security as they help protect against different types of attacks such as XSS, code injection, and session hijacking. In this talk, we'll discuss the most common security headers, how to configure them properly, and look at some real-world examples of misconfigurations that led to successful attacks.

#### Speaker Biography

**Walter Mart&iacute;n Villalba** is a Principal Application Security Consultant at C13 Security, a company he started recently. He leads the OWASP Santa Barbara chapter and is one of the key organizers for the AppSec California conference. He loves foosball and cyberpunk culture. **Twitter:** [@act1vand0](https://twitter.com/act1vand0); **LinkedIn:** [wmvillalba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wmvillalba/)

## Hour 11 - Hosted by OWASP Hawaii (USA)

### Session Host: Jason Sewell, *Chapter Leader*

### Lyft Cartography: Using Graphs to Improve and Scale Security Decision-Making
*Alex Chantavy*

#### Abstract

This talk highlights how we leverage Cartography ([https://github.com/lyft/cartography](https://github.com/lyft/cartography)) at Lyft to improve and scale security decision-making. Attendees of this session will be introduced to our platform and shown a broad set of compelling scenarios including reducing security debt, tracking and alerting on infrastructure changes, and enabling teams to see and better understand their security risk. 

Cartography is a free open-source tool that consolidates your technical assets and the relationships between them in an intuitive graph database to enable quick exploration, repeatable decisions, and automated workflows.

We hope that sharing our approach to these problems with Cartography will help you achieve these same outcomes in your own organizations.  We have been thrilled to grow the community in our first couple years as an open source project and look forward to hearing your feedback!

#### Speaker Biography

**Alex Chantavy** is a software engineer on Lyft's security team (and also happens to be from Makakilo, HI). As one of the developers on Cartography, his security interests are understanding cloud permissions relationships and finding opportunities for lateral movement. In previous roles, Alex has performed red teaming as well as security tool development. In short, he enjoys learning easy ways to make computers do what they're not supposed to do, making robots do his homework, and showing others how to do the same.

### Content Security Policy: Drawing the Rest of the Owl
*Neil Matatall*

#### Abstract

Content security policy (CSP) is a browser feature that allows an application to tell a browser what is allowed to happen on a given page. It can be a very powerful tool when used correctly. But it's a tricky beast with a lot of complexity, esoteric details, gotchas, and is still not widely adopted by most of the Internet, by any measure.

Any random article on CSP will talk about its features and behaviors. Some talk about the "report-only" mode for testing out CSP and analyzing reports. But how do you go from no CSP to a solid CSP? A light overview of CSP with a focus on mitigating cross-site scripting will be followed by an explanation of strategies to create an effective and dynamic policy including code samples taken directly from the GitHub codebase.

#### Speaker Biography

**Neil Matatall**  is a product security engineer at GitHub that focuses on account security and security UX. Having started off in development with two separate development stints in between, the majority of his work has been in the application security space hardening frameworks, creating libraries, and working with standards bodies. Neil is often considered a hipster because he likes Ruby on Rails. He is also the first user to ever get locked out of their Twitter account because of 2FA.

## Hour 13 - Hosted by OWASP New Zealand

### Session Host: John DiLeo, *Chapter Leader*

### Small, But Fierce (But Still Small)
*Erica Anderson*

##### Abstract

Most of us volunteer or work closely with small groups. These are the local community groups, the side gigs, the small family businesses, the weekend projects. These groups are small but mighty. They use data, technology, and systems to provide us a service to make our communities better places. We need them to exist; and we also need them to be secure. This talk is going to focus on the few, free steps that any small group can take to level up their security, the stories and reasoning behind them, and give you some manna for dispelling the security misconceptions that come with being small.

#### Speaker Biography

**Erica Anderson:** Her twitter bio says "info sec, cat, and ketchup enthusiast" which summarizes her quite nicely. Erica is a space cadet (and Principal Security Consultant) for SafeStack and leads their Wellington presence. She also causes general mayhem with Kiwicon, Kawaiicon, and (previously) BSides Wellington. **Twitter:** [@sputina](https://twitter.com/sputina)

### Let Me Secure That for You
*Kirk Jackson - Chapter Leader, OWASP New Zealand*

#### Abstract

Is it possible to wrap security around an insecure website? Wouldn't it be great if security was something you could just add later?

This talk will introduce virtual patching, what types of security issues can be fixed, and dive a bit deeper into Content Security Policy.

#### Speaker Biography

**Kirk Jackson** works at RedShield in Wellington, leads OWASP New Zealand's Wellington Meetup, and has previously helped organize the annual OWASP New Zealand Day conference in Auckland.

Kirk worked as a web developer before switching to the defense team - setting up the security practice at Xero, working as a pen tester, and in defense roles at several companies.
