### Is Your Phone Your Enemy or Your Friend?
*Silvia Arias Becker and Oscar Orellana Artigas*

#### Abstract

In this presentation, we will provide information related to the risks you are exposed to through the apps you download to your mobile. We will review the OWASP Mobile Top 10 and use them in real APK analysis. If you are using your mobile more than ever for social media and even for work, this is the presentation you need in your life now!

Telephone devices have become our biggest repository of personal and private information, containing our banking and social network data. They allow us to read news and choose the type of information we want to read, creating a clear profile of our tastes and preferences.  They also store the personal data of our family and people with whom we interact frequently.

All of the above is great, if it is under our control and we can privately isolate that personal information. So what happens if our phone's operating system decides to publish that data or share it so other entities can access and know our tastes and everything that we thought was private?
